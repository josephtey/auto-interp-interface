  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully, noting the precise location of activation spikes and their relationship to surrounding genomic annotations. In each case, I observed a very consistent pattern: strong, sharp activation spikes occurring at specific positions within or near protein-coding sequences, particularly those encoding transporters and membrane proteins. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent across examples - a single, distinct spike rather than broad regions of activation.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at specific positions within or adjacent to genes encoding membrane-associated proteins, particularly transporters (AraJ permease, Tim44 transport protein, TerC family transporter, ABC transporters, sulfate transporters) and membrane proteins. The activation spike is precise and localized, suggesting it might detect a specific sequence motif commonly found in these genes, potentially related to transmembrane domains or signal sequences. The consistent spike pattern across diverse bacterial genomes suggests this feature captures a highly conserved sequence element.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly identifies a specific sequence motif common in membrane transporter genes and related proteins.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif commonly found within or adjacent to genes encoding membrane transport proteins and other membrane-associated proteins. The activation pattern is characterized by sharp, distinct spikes at precise genomic positions rather than broad regions of activation. The feature appears to be recognizing a highly conserved sequence element that is functionally important in membrane proteins, particularly transporters across multiple bacterial families. This could represent a transmembrane domain signature, a signal sequence, or another conserved motif essential for proper membrane protein folding or function. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial genomes, suggesting evolutionary conservation of this sequence element due to its functional importance in membrane protein biology.",
