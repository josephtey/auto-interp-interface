  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, identifying where the feature fires most strongly in relation to genomic elements. I examined each spike's position, strength, and relationship to specific genes/gene families.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, sharp activation spikes within or near genes encoding essential enzymatic components of secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, particularly polyketide synthases (PKS). In examples where PKS genes are present (sections 3, 6, 7), the feature activates directly. In other examples, the feature activates near genes involved in related enzymatic functions that could be involved in secondary metabolism.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects specific sequence motifs within polyketide synthase genes and related biosynthetic enzymes.",

  "description": "This feature detects sequence motifs specific to polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and related secondary metabolism biosynthetic enzymes. When present, PKS genes (sections 3, 6, 7) trigger strong activation spikes, suggesting the feature recognizes conserved catalytic domains or binding motifs within these large modular enzymes. The feature shows highest activation in firmicutes and proteobacteria. The consistent sharp spike pattern indicates recognition of a highly specific sequence element rather than general gene structure. This likely represents detection of functional domains critical for secondary metabolite biosynthesis, which would be valuable for identifying biosynthetic gene clusters in bacterial genomes.",
