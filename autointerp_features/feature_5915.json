  "reasoning": "I analyzed the patterns of feature activation across the 10 genomic examples, examining each spike's position relative to various genomic annotations. I looked for consistent relationships between activation and specific genes, RNA elements, or structural features. The feature consistently shows strong, sharp single spike activations without broader patterns.",
  "findings": "The activations consistently occur at or near non-coding RNA elements or regions with regulatory function. In section_6, activation occurs precisely at a tRNA (trnF); in section_0, the activation appears near CRISPR repeats; in section_7, it activates near Flavo-1 RNA. Where no obvious RNA element is visible, the activation often occurs in regions between genes that might contain unannotated regulatory elements. The sharp, precise nature of these activations suggests recognition of a specific sequence or structural motif common to RNA-related elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern related to non-coding RNA elements or specific sequence/structural signatures associated with RNA processing or regulation.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific sequence motifs associated with non-coding RNA elements or regions involved in RNA processing. The activations manifest as sharp, distinct spikes that occur precisely at or near tRNA genes (as in section_6), CRISPR-associated elements (section_0 and section_7), or other non-coding RNAs (section_7 with Flavo-1 RNA). In cases where no RNA element is explicitly annotated, the feature may be detecting unannotated RNA elements or specific sequence motifs common to RNA regulatory regions. The consistent spike pattern and association with RNA-related elements across diverse genomes suggests this feature is capturing a functionally relevant genomic signature related to RNA biology, potentially identifying conserved structural or sequence elements important for RNA processing, stability, or function.",
