  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify common patterns between feature activations and genomic annotations. I observed sharp spike activations at specific genomic positions, noting the exact location of these spikes relative to annotated genes. I compared these positions across all examples to identify consistent relationships between the feature activation and specific genomic elements.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, sharp spike activations at or near tRNA genes. In section_2.png, the activation coincides precisely with trnN (tRNA-Asn). While some images don't explicitly show tRNA annotations, the feature activation pattern is remarkably consistent - a single sharp spike rather than broad activation regions. The spike pattern is highly specific and localized, suggesting detection of a conserved sequence element or structural motif characteristic of tRNAs or adjacent regulatory regions across diverse bacterial species.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects tRNA genes or a specific sequence motif associated with tRNAs across various bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects tRNA genes or a highly specific sequence motif associated with tRNAs. The activation pattern consistently shows a sharp, discrete spike at the precise location of tRNA genes when annotated (as clearly seen in section_2.png with trnN). The feature appears to be capturing either the conserved structural elements of tRNAs themselves or regulatory motifs closely associated with tRNA positioning. The signal is remarkably consistent across diverse bacterial genomes, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The specificity and sharpness of the activation spike suggests recognition of a highly conserved sequence element rather than broader gene context, which aligns with the evolutionary conservation of tRNA structures across bacterial species.",
