{
  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns of this feature across all provided genomic examples, focusing on where the highest activation peaks occur in relation to gene annotations. I noticed strong and consistent peak patterns at gene boundaries, particularly at the 3' ends (terminators) of genes.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong activation at the 3' terminal regions of genes across multiple examples, regardless of the specific gene function. The activation pattern forms sharp, distinct peaks at gene boundaries rather than across entire genes. These peaks appear most prominently where one gene ends before another begins, suggesting detection of transcriptional terminator structures. The feature is particularly active in alpha-proteobacteria genomes (especially Roseicyclus elongatus).",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern consistent with bacterial gene terminators or 3' end structures.",

  "description": "This feature detects transcriptional terminator regions at the 3' end of bacterial genes. It consistently shows sharp activation spikes at gene boundaries, specifically at the terminal regions of various genes regardless of their function. The feature likely recognizes sequence characteristics associated with rho-independent terminators, such as GC-rich hairpin structures followed by poly-U tails. This pattern is highly consistent across multiple examples from alpha-proteobacterial genomes, especially Roseicyclus elongatus, suggesting the feature has captured a fundamental genomic structural element involved in transcription termination in bacteria.",
