  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I examined activation peaks, their strength, and their relationship to specific genomic elements. I looked for recurring elements or positions where strong activations consistently appeared across multiple examples. I noted gene functions, locations, and any patterns between different examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, sharp activation peaks at gene transitions or boundaries where coding sequences (CDS) meet or end. These activation spikes typically appear at the beginning or end of genes, particularly at intergenic regions where genes may change direction or at the junctions between closely positioned genes. The pattern of activation is specific and localized, forming distinct spikes rather than broad regions of activation. These transitions often involve genes with diverse functions, with no particular preference for specific gene families, suggesting the feature is detecting a structural or organizational pattern in the genome rather than specific gene content.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures biologically meaningful transitions between coding sequences, likely detecting sequence patterns associated with gene boundaries or regulatory elements between genes.",

  "description": "This feature consistently detects the boundaries or transitions between adjacent genes in bacterial genomes. The activation pattern shows sharp, localized spikes that occur precisely at the junctions where genes meet or where intergenic regions exist between genes. The feature appears to be detecting sequence characteristics associated with gene transitions rather than the content of specific genes themselves, as the genes involved have diverse functions across the examples. This pattern suggests the feature may be identifying regulatory elements, transcriptional terminators/initiators, or structural DNA motifs that commonly exist at gene boundaries. The consistency of this pattern across multiple examples from different genomic regions indicates this is a fundamental structural feature of genome organization. This detection capability could be important for genome annotation, identifying potential regulatory regions, or understanding genome architecture.",
