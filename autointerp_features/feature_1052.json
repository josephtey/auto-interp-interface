  "reasoning": "I examined each example to identify consistent patterns of feature activation in relation to genomic annotations. I noted that sharp activation spikes frequently occur at or near response regulator proteins, histidine kinases, and other components of bacterial two-component signaling systems. The feature shows strong, focused activations rather than broad regions of activation.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently detects bacterial two-component signaling systems, particularly around response regulators and histidine kinases. In multiple examples, activation peaks occur near genes annotated as \"response regulator transcription factor,\" \"DNA-binding response regulator,\" \"histidine kinase,\" or related regulatory components. The feature activates across diverse bacterial phyla, suggesting it identifies a conserved signature sequence or structure common to these regulatory systems.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with bacterial two-component signaling systems.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects components of bacterial two-component signaling systems, particularly response regulators and histidine kinases. The activation pattern shows sharp, focused spikes at or near genes encoding these regulatory proteins across diverse bacterial phyla. Two-component systems enable bacteria to sense and respond to environmental signals through phosphorylation cascades. The feature appears to recognize sequence motifs or structural elements characteristic of these signaling proteins, suggesting it captures functionally important regions involved in signal transduction. The pattern is highly consistent across examples and taxonomically diverse bacterial species, indicating the feature has identified a conserved and biologically significant genomic signature.",
