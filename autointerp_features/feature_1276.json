  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify genomic patterns where the feature activates. Each image shows a distinct activation spike at a specific genome position. I examined the positional relationships between these spikes and the annotated genes to identify common patterns.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates as sharp, narrow spikes at specific positions that appear to represent intergenic regions or gene boundaries. In most examples, the activation occurs near or between genes involved in bacterial metabolic or regulatory pathways. The feature appears preferentially activated at boundaries between functionally related gene clusters or operons, particularly those involved in bacterial metabolism, transport, or regulatory function.",
  "conclusion": "The feature captures bacterial intergenic regions or regulatory elements at gene boundaries, likely representing promoters or other regulatory motifs.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific intergenic regions in bacterial genomes, particularly at boundaries between operons or functionally related genes. The activation consistently appears as sharp spikes at positions that likely contain promoters, terminators, or other regulatory elements controlling gene expression. The feature activates near genes involved in various metabolic pathways (transport systems, two-component systems, metabolic enzymes), suggesting it may recognize a common regulatory motif shared across diverse bacterial species. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from different bacterial phyla (including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes), indicating it detects a fundamental regulatory element in bacterial genomic architecture. This feature may represent a conserved promoter element, transcription factor binding site, or other DNA motif important for coordinating bacterial gene expression.",
