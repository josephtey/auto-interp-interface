  "reasoning": "I examined each example to identify the relationship between feature activation spikes and genomic annotations. I observed that strong, sharp activation spikes consistently appeared near or directly over tRNA genes in multiple examples. I compared activation patterns across all examples to confirm this pattern was not coincidental.",
  "findings": "The feature shows sharp, high-magnitude activation spikes precisely at or very near tRNA genes in multiple examples. In section_4, the spike appears at trnN (tRNA-Asn); in section_8, at trnP (tRNA-Pro); and in section_3, at trnV (tRNA-Val). The activation pattern is highly specific, showing almost no activity elsewhere in the genomic region. The feature appears organism-agnostic, functioning across different bacterial species.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to tRNA genes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes across bacterial genomes. It activates with sharp, high-magnitude spikes directly at the position of tRNA elements. The feature shows exceptional specificity, with minimal activation elsewhere in the genome. This suggests the feature is recognizing conserved structural or sequence characteristics unique to tRNA genes, which are essential for protein translation in all organisms. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacteria (including Mycoplasma, Qipengyuania, and unknown species), indicating it detects fundamental tRNA properties rather than organism-specific variants. The consistent detection across different tRNA types (Asn, Pro, Val) suggests it recognizes core tRNA features rather than isotype-specific elements.",
