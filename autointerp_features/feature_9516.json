  "reasoning": "I examined each image closely, noting where the feature activates in relation to gene annotations. In each case, there's a single sharp spike of activation with consistent positioning. I compared annotations across genomes to identify commonalities at activation sites.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at sigma factors (rpoE) or near cell division/DNA topology genes (SMC, parC, parE, gyrB). In multiple examples, activations occur specifically at the junction between sigma factors and neighboring genes. Most notable is the striking pattern of activation near DNA topology genes (topoisomerases, DNA gyrase) in several examples, suggesting a potential regulatory element or specialized sequence motif.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects a specific DNA sequence motif related to sigma factors and DNA topology regulation across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif at or near sigma factors (particularly rpoE/sigma24) and DNA topology genes (topoisomerases, gyrases, SMC proteins). The activation consistently appears as a precise spike at regulatory junctions between these elements and neighboring genes, suggesting a conserved regulatory motif or sequence element. The pattern appears across diverse bacterial phyla (alpha/beta-proteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Firmicutes), indicating an evolutionarily conserved sequence that may coordinate stress responses with chromosomal maintenance. The feature likely represents a specialized promoter or regulatory element coordinating stress response and DNA topology in bacteria.",
