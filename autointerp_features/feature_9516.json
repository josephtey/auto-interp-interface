  "reasoning": "I examined each example for activation patterns, focusing on the precise location of activation spikes and their relationship to surrounding genomic annotations. I noted that in almost all examples, the activation shows a sharp, discrete spike rather than continuous activations. I mapped these spike locations to determine what genomic elements consistently appear at or near these activation sites.",
  "findings": "The most striking pattern across examples is that activation spikes consistently appear at or very near tRNA genes. In section_0 and section_6, the spikes align directly with annotated tRNAs (trnV: tRNA-Val in section_0, trnD: tRNA-Asp in section_6). In section_7, the activation corresponds to the SdsR_RyeB RNA. In section_9, the spike appears near the L31-Gammaproteobacteria ribosomal protein leader (ncRNA-region). In other examples without explicitly annotated RNA elements, the sharp activation pattern is maintained, suggesting the feature is detecting a consistent structural or sequence motif characteristic of non-coding RNA elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects tRNA genes and other structured non-coding RNA elements across different genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and other structured non-coding RNA elements. The activation pattern shows sharp, discrete spikes precisely at the location of these RNA elements, suggesting detection of a conserved structural or sequence motif common to tRNAs and certain other ncRNAs. This is particularly evident in examples where tRNAs are explicitly annotated (tRNA-Val and tRNA-Asp), but the consistent spike pattern appears in other examples likely detecting unannotated RNA elements or RNA-related structures. The feature appears to be detecting fundamental RNA elements involved in translation and possibly other RNA-mediated regulatory functions. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with clear, isolated activation spikes rather than broad regions of activation.",
