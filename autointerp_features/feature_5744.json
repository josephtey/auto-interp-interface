  "reasoning": "I examined each example carefully, noting activation patterns and their relationship to genomic annotations. In 8 out of 10 examples, the feature shows strong activation specifically over or near methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) genes, often labeled as \"tar\" or described as \"Methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein\". The activation pattern consistently appears as clustered spikes directly overlapping these MCP genes. This pattern is evident in examples 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and others. The feature shows high fidelity - when MCPs are present, the feature activates strongly.",
  "findings": "This feature specifically detects methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), which are transmembrane receptors involved in bacterial chemotaxis. MCPs detect chemical gradients in the environment and transmit signals to the flagellar motor complex, allowing bacteria to move toward attractants or away from repellents. The feature activation is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa including Spirochetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, suggesting it captures a conserved sequence motif or structural element specific to these sensory proteins.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with bacterial chemotaxis receptors across multiple bacterial phyla.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), key components of bacterial sensory systems. The activation pattern shows strong, continuous firing directly over MCP-encoding genes (often annotated as \"tar\") across diverse bacterial species. MCPs are transmembrane receptors that detect environmental chemical signals and initiate appropriate movement responses in bacteria. The feature may be detecting conserved protein domains like HAMP, PAS, or methyl-accepting domains characteristic of these proteins. The pattern is remarkably consistent across examples and appears in multiple bacterial phyla (Spirochetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes), indicating it detects a functionally conserved genomic element critical for bacterial environmental sensing and motility.",
