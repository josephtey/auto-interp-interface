  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image carefully to identify patterns in feature activation across the genomic sequences. I noted the exact locations of activation peaks, their relationship to annotated genetic elements, and examined recurring patterns across all examples. I paid special attention to where the strongest activations occurred and which genomic elements were consistently present at or near these activations.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation patterns that correspond to CRISPR elements. In multiple examples (sections 0, 3, 4, 6), activation peaks directly overlap with CRISPR-related annotations such as CRISPR repeats and spacers. The activation patterns often show distinctive, clustered peaks with high intensity (reaching values of 2-3) in these regions. In section_1, section_4, and section_6, the activations align precisely with annotated CRISPR repeat and spacer elements. The remaining examples show similar activation patterns but in regions where CRISPR elements may be present but not explicitly annotated.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays across different bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) arrays in bacterial genomes. The activation pattern shows characteristic clustered spikes that correspond to the repetitive structure of CRISPR arrays, with the highest peaks likely representing the repeat elements or the repeat-spacer junctions. The feature appears to identify these regions regardless of the specific CRISPR system type. This detection is biologically significant as CRISPR regions serve as bacterial adaptive immune systems against phage infection. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, showing strong activation specifically in regions annotated as CRISPR repeats or spacers, while remaining inactive in other genomic regions. This suggests the feature has learned the unique sequence or structural signature that distinguishes CRISPR arrays from other genomic elements.",
