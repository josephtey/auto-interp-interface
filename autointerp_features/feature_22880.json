  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, looking for consistent relationships with genomic annotations. I noticed strong activation patterns consistently occurring near or within HEAT repeat domain-containing proteins across multiple genomes. In examples where HEAT repeat proteins are annotated (sections 9, 6, 7, 2), the feature shows distinct activation patterns directly associated with these proteins. This pattern is consistent regardless of the organism type.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates within or near genes encoding HEAT repeat-containing proteins in multiple bacterial genomes. These proteins, characterized by tandemly repeated units forming superhelical structures, are involved in protein-protein interactions and various cellular processes. The activation is specifically linked to the HEAT repeat domain sequences rather than flanking regions. In section 9, activation coincides with a \"HEAT repeat protein\"; in section 7, with a \"PBS lyase HEAT domain protein\"; in section 2, with a \"HEAT repeats family protein\"; and in section 6, with a \"HEAT repeat domain-containing protein.\"",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects HEAT repeat protein coding sequences across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects coding sequences for HEAT repeat domain-containing proteins across bacterial genomes. It consistently shows strong activation patterns spanning the length of these genes, with multiple peaks indicating the repetitive nature of HEAT domains. HEAT repeats are structural motifs consisting of two anti-parallel alpha helices linked by a short loop, and are involved in protein-protein interactions, intracellular transport, and other cellular processes. The feature shows high specificity to these domains regardless of the specific bacterial species, suggesting it captures the conserved sequence patterns characteristic of HEAT repeat structures. The consistency across examples from different bacteria (including Haliangium ochraceum and Rickettsia) indicates this is a broadly applicable genomic element detector that could help identify previously unannotated HEAT repeat proteins in diverse prokaryotic genomes.",
