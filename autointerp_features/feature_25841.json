{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I examined the location, strength, and context of activation peaks, noting consistent patterns across examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates with a sharp, high-amplitude spike between gene boundaries. In all examples, the activation occurs precisely at intergenic regions, often between genes with different orientations or functional categories. This pattern appears across diverse bacterial genomes, suggesting a universal genomic element.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to intergenic regulatory regions or transcriptional boundaries.",
  "title": "Intergenic Boundary Recognition Feature",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects intergenic boundaries between adjacent genes. The activation consistently appears as a sharp spike precisely at gene junctions, particularly where genes have opposing orientations (divergent or convergent). These locations likely represent regulatory regions containing promoters, terminators, or other transcriptional control elements. The feature may be detecting specific DNA structural motifs or sequence signatures associated with transcriptional boundaries that are conserved across bacterial species. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, appearing regardless of the specific gene functions, suggesting it captures a fundamental organizational principle of bacterial genomes related to transcriptional unit separation.",
