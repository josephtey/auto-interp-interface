  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify patterns in feature activation and their relationship to genomic annotations. I focused on the sharp, high-magnitude activation spikes and their consistent positioning relative to specific genomic elements across all examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, sharp activation peaks near tRNA genes in multiple genomes. In section_7.png, activation occurs near tRNA-Ser genes. In section_6.png, it activates near tRNA-Pro. In section_2.png, activation occurs at the edge of a CRISPR array. The feature shows similar spike-like activation patterns across diverse organisms including proteobacteria, crenarchaeotes, and others, suggesting it detects a conserved sequence or structural element related to tRNAs or RNA-processing regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly identifies tRNA genes or related RNA structural elements across diverse prokaryotic genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects tRNA genes or similar RNA structural elements across bacterial and archaeal genomes. The activation shows as sharp, high-magnitude spikes precisely at or adjacent to tRNA loci. In section_6.png and section_7.png, we clearly see activation near annotated tRNAs (tRNA-Pro and tRNA-Ser respectively). The activation pattern is highly consistent - always showing as a discrete, narrow spike rather than a broad region. This suggests the feature recognizes a specific conserved sequence motif or structural characteristic universal to tRNAs, possibly related to the cloverleaf secondary structure or promoter elements. The feature activates across diverse taxonomic groups including both bacteria (proteobacteria) and archaea (Hyperthermus), indicating it captures an evolutionarily ancient and conserved element of tRNA biology.",
