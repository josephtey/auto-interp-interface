  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example individually to identify patterns in feature activation. I observed sharp, high-amplitude spikes occurring at specific genomic locations across all examples. I carefully examined the relationship between these activation spikes and the annotated genomic elements, looking for consistent patterns in terms of which genes or elements were present at or near activation sites.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp, singular activation spikes that occur at specific locations within or near gene boundaries. In most examples, these activations appear to coincide with gene boundaries or transitions between genes, often at the terminal regions of coding sequences. The spikes frequently occur at or near tRNA genes, transporters, and metabolic enzymes, suggesting a possible role in recognizing specific sequence motifs at gene junctions. The feature's activation is highly localized (spike-like) rather than continuous across regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect a specific nucleotide motif or structural element that occurs at gene boundaries or transitions in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif or structural element that commonly occurs at gene boundaries or transition points between genes in bacterial genomes. The activation is characterized by sharp, high-amplitude spikes that precisely mark these transition points. The feature appears particularly sensitive to boundaries involving transporters, tRNA genes, and metabolic enzymes, suggesting it may be detecting a conserved regulatory or structural element that facilitates gene expression transitions or termination signals. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial genomic contexts, indicating it represents a fundamentally important sequence element for genomic organization. This feature likely corresponds to a specific nucleotide motif that serves a role in transcription termination, translation initiation, or another process related to gene transitions.",
