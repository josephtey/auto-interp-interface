  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all 10 genomic regions, focusing on when and where the feature shows strong activation. In each example, I identified the specific genes or elements at or near activation peaks, looking for common patterns in gene function, position, or genomic context.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, the feature shows strong activation in regions associated with membrane transport or transmembrane proteins. In example 1, peak activation occurs over the MarR transcriptional regulator. In examples 2, 5, 6, and 8, activation peaks near transport-related proteins (WXG100 secretion target, GatC amidotransferase, ExbB biopolymer transporter, and Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase). In example 3, activation occurs near the ribonuclease E (rne) gene. The feature consistently shows sharp, focused activation patterns rather than broad regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with membrane transport and transcriptional regulation elements.",
  "title": "Membrane transport and regulatory element detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects regulatory elements and membrane transport proteins, particularly those involved in transcriptional regulation (MarR family), biopolymer transport (ExbB), and secretion systems (WXG100, T-box leaders). The feature activates at or near the gene body of these transport-associated elements, suggesting sensitivity to specific sequence motifs within these genes. This likely represents detection of a conserved domain or motif present in various transport and regulatory proteins. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria (both alpha and gamma) and Firmicutes, indicating conservation of this element across bacterial evolution.",
