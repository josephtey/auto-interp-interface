  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across multiple examples, examining where the feature shows high activation in relation to genomic elements. I noticed strong, consistent peaks associated with specific genes, particularly related to redox processes and sulfur metabolism.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong and specific activation associated with protein-methionine-sulfoxide reductase systems (MsrP/MsrQ) in multiple examples (sections 1, 4, 6). These proteins are involved in repairing oxidized methionine residues. Additional activations occur near related sulfur-handling proteins like thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (GlpE) and sulfurtransferase (TusA). The pattern appears consistently across proteobacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects methionine sulfoxide reductase systems and related sulfur metabolism components.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects protein-methionine-sulfoxide reductase systems (MsrP/MsrQ), which repair oxidatively damaged proteins by reducing methionine sulfoxide back to methionine. The feature shows strong activation directly over msrP/msrQ genes or their immediate vicinity. These enzymes play a critical role in bacterial oxidative stress response and protein repair. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from proteobacteria (both alpha and gamma), indicating a conserved genomic signature. Related sulfur-handling enzymes like sulfurtransferases sometimes show weaker co-activation, suggesting detection of a broader sulfur metabolism network centered on methionine oxidation repair.",
