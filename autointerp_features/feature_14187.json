  "reasoning": "I analyzed activation patterns and gene annotations across all examples, looking for consistent relationships between feature activation and specific genomic elements. I noticed strong, spike-like activations consistently associated with short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family proteins or related NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases.",
  "findings": "The feature shows high activation peaks specifically associated with genes annotated as SDR family proteins, NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases, or related oxidoreductases. This pattern is evident in multiple examples: Hirschia baltica (section_4, ID 2: fabG), Thermotoga petrophila (section_2, ID 1: fabG), Ferrimonas lipolytica (section_7, ID 2 and ID 9), Agarivorans albus (section_3, ID 15), and Hypericibacter terrae (section_0, ID 10). The feature activation typically forms a distinct spike pattern at the precise location of these genes, suggesting detection of specific sequence characteristics unique to this enzyme family.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family genes across diverse bacterial phyla.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects genes encoding short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family proteins and related NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases. It shows strong, localized activation directly over these genes, suggesting recognition of conserved sequence motifs specific to this enzyme family. The SDR superfamily comprises metabolically important oxidoreductases involved in various redox reactions. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial phyla (alpha-proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria, thermotogales), indicating the feature captures evolutionarily conserved sequence characteristics of this ancient and functionally important enzyme family.",
