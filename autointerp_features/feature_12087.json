  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all examples, noting the precise locations of activation spikes relative to genomic annotations. For each example, I identified the genes/elements that coincided with or were adjacent to the activation peaks. I then looked for recurring patterns in terms of genetic elements or positional relationships.",
  "findings": "In all examples, the feature shows a distinct sharp spike activation pattern with maximum intensity (1.0). These activation spikes consistently appear near intergenic boundaries, often at the junction between coding sequences or at the edge of CRISPR elements. In section_2, the activation coincides with a 16S rRNA gene. In section_6, the spike appears near CRISPR repeat elements. Across bacterial genomes, several activation sites are adjacent to transcriptional regulators (e.g., section_0: hrcA, section_4: acrR, section_6: ompR), which suggests this feature may be detecting a specific regulatory sequence motif at gene boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful signal related to bacterial gene boundaries and possible transcriptional regulatory motifs.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific sequence motifs at intergenic regions in bacterial genomes, particularly at the boundaries between coding sequences or near non-coding elements like CRISPR repeats. The consistent sharp spike pattern suggests recognition of a well-defined sequence motif rather than a broader structural element. The proximity to transcriptional regulators in several examples (hrcA, acrR, ompR, PhoB) suggests this motif may play a role in transcriptional regulation, possibly representing a promoter element or transcription factor binding site. The feature demonstrates high consistency across diverse bacterial genomic contexts, making it a robust detector of these intergenic regulatory regions.",
