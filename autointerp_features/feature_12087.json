  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, focusing on their positions relative to gene annotations. Each example shows a sharp, high-intensity spike at a specific genomic location. I examined what genes are located near these activation points and looked for commonalities across different bacterial species.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at the junction between genes, particularly at the transition between functionally distinct genes. The spike appears at intergenic regions rather than within coding sequences. Notable observations include: activation between GNAT acetyltransferases and adjacent genes (sections 2, 8), between metabolic enzymes and transporters (sections 6, 9), between cell wall/membrane proteins and other functional classes (sections 3, 4), and between regulatory elements and structural genes (sections 0, 5, 7).",
  "conclusion": "This feature recognizes intergenic regions that serve as transition points between functionally distinct gene clusters across diverse bacterial phyla.",

  "description": "This feature detects intergenic regions between functionally distinct bacterial genes, specifically identifying transition points in operonic or genomic organization. The feature consistently shows sharp activation spikes precisely at gene junctions rather than within coding sequences. These junctions often separate genes involved in different cellular processes (e.g., between cell wall biosynthesis genes and regulatory proteins, or between metabolic enzymes and transporters). The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla (proteobacteria, gram-positives, CFB group) and likely represents regulatory sequences or transcriptional boundaries that mark functional transitions in bacterial genome architecture. This feature may be capturing promoter regions, terminators, or other regulatory elements that separate functionally distinct gene clusters.",
