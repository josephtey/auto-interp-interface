  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, noting the consistent appearance of specific transcriptional regulators (particularly MarR family) in close proximity to the activation peaks. In most examples, the feature shows strong, localized activation peaks adjacent to or directly over transcriptional regulator genes, especially those of the MarR family. These regulators are frequently positioned near genes involved in stress response, drug resistance, or metabolic regulation.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at or near MarR family transcriptional regulator genes across multiple bacterial genomes (primarily high G+C Gram-positive bacteria). In examples 0, 4, 5, and 6, the activation peaks are precisely positioned at or adjacent to genes annotated as \"MarR family transcriptional regulator\" or similar variants. The surrounding context frequently includes genes involved in multidrug resistance, detoxification, or stress response mechanisms, which is consistent with the known role of MarR regulators in controlling these functions. The strong and specific activation pattern suggests this feature recognizes either the MarR gene sequences themselves or associated regulatory elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to MarR family transcriptional regulators and their associated genomic context.",

  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects MarR family transcriptional regulator genes in bacterial genomes. The activation peaks occur directly at or immediately adjacent to MarR regulator annotations across multiple examples. MarR regulators control expression of genes involved in responses to environmental stresses, antibiotics, and toxic compounds. The consistent genomic context includes genes for multidrug transporters, detoxification enzymes, and stress response proteins, which aligns with MarR's known biological function as a repressor of these systems. This pattern is highly consistent across examples and appears particularly active in actinobacteria (Mycolicibacterium, Corynebacterium) and firmicutes, suggesting the feature may recognize conserved sequence characteristics of MarR genes or their promoter regions across diverse bacterial taxa.",
