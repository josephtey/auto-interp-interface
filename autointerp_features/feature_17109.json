  "reasoning": "I examined each example to identify patterns between high activation peaks and genomic features. I paid special attention to the relative position of activations and the types of genes or elements present in those regions. Looking across all examples, I noticed consistent patterns with tRNA genes or their proximity to specific genomic elements.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation peaks precisely at or immediately adjacent to tRNA genes in multiple examples. In examples where tRNAs are annotated (sections 0 and 4), the activation directly coincides with tRNA-Lys and tRNA-Leu respectively. In examples without annotated tRNAs, the activation pattern appears at regions that likely contain unannotated tRNAs or structural elements with similar sequence characteristics. This suggests the feature is detecting tRNA genes or their characteristic promoter/terminator structures.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with tRNA genes or their characteristic structural elements.",
  "title": "tRNA gene detector",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes or their associated regulatory elements. The activation pattern shows sharp, distinct spikes that directly coincide with annotated tRNA positions when present. In section_0 and section_4, we see direct association with tRNA-Lys and tRNA-Leu respectively. In other examples without explicit tRNA annotations, the consistent spike pattern suggests the feature may be detecting unnannotated tRNA genes or similar structural elements. tRNAs have distinctive structural features including conserved internal promoters, specific secondary structure, and characteristic termination signals, which this feature likely recognizes. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, showing selective activation for these specific RNA genes that play essential roles in translation.",
