  "reasoning": "I examined each example for feature activation patterns and their relationship to genomic annotations. I noted that the feature consistently shows sharp, high-amplitude spike activations at specific locations rather than broad regions. The activation appears precisely at or near gene boundaries, particularly at the boundaries between adjacent genes or at the end of genes. The activation strength varies but consistently shows as distinct, narrow peaks.",
  "findings": "Across all 10 examples, the feature activation represents sharp transition points in genomic context, primarily at gene boundaries or intergenic regions. The activation pattern doesn't correlate with specific gene functions but rather with the structural organization of adjacent genes. This suggests the feature detects sequence motifs or structural elements that mark transitions between coding regions. The feature may be capturing terminator sequences, promoter elements, or other regulatory motifs that delineate gene boundaries in prokaryotic genomes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to gene boundary regions or intergenic spacers in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific sequence patterns at gene boundaries or in intergenic regions of bacterial genomes. The sharp, high-amplitude spike activations consistently appear at transitions between genes or at the termination points of genes. These regions likely contain terminator sequences, regulatory elements, or promoters that define gene boundaries in prokaryotic genomes. The feature may be identifying Rho-independent terminators, intergenic spacers, or other structural elements that help organize the genome architecture. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial genomes and different functional gene categories, suggesting it captures a fundamental aspect of prokaryotic genome organization rather than specific gene functions. This feature likely plays a role in identifying genome structural transitions important for transcription termination and initiation processes.",
