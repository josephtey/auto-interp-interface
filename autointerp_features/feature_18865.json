  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify consistent patterns between feature activation and genomic elements. I examined the precise location and strength of activation spikes relative to the annotated genes. I noted the specific gene that each activation spike aligned with and looked for patterns across examples.",
  "findings": "The activation pattern consistently appears as sharp spikes at positions that align with specific genes in bacterial genomes. In all examples, the feature activates strongly at positions where a transport-related protein is present. Specifically, the feature activates at ABC transporters (sections 1, 8), periplasmic components (sections 1, 8), and various other membrane transport proteins (sections 2, 5, 7). The activation is precise and shows high specificity for transport system components, particularly ABC-type transporters and their periplasmic binding proteins.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects bacterial transport system proteins, especially ABC transporters and associated components.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects ABC-type transport systems and related membrane transport proteins in bacterial genomes. It activates precisely at genes encoding periplasmic components (ddpA/dppA), permease components (dppB/dppC), and other transport-related proteins. The feature shows strong, sharp activation peaks that align with transport genes across diverse bacterial phyla including Gemmatimonas, Desulfomicrobium, and Pedobacter. The detection pattern suggests functional recognition of conserved sequence motifs in bacterial transport systems, particularly those involved in oligopeptide, dipeptide, or nutrient transport. The consistent activation across different bacterial species indicates this feature captures evolutionarily conserved components of bacterial transport machinery, which are essential for nutrient uptake and cellular homeostasis.",
