  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across multiple bacterial genomes, focusing on correlations between peak activations and specific gene annotations. I observed consistently high activations associated with large synthase/synthetase genes, particularly non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS), as well as other large modular enzymes involved in secondary metabolism.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates across large multi-domain synthase/synthetase genes, particularly showing strong activation patterns along the entire length of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (e.g., solG in Xenorhabdus) and related enzymes such as amino acid adenylation domains in Frankia. The pattern shows distributed high-amplitude spikes throughout these genes rather than concentrated at specific boundaries, suggesting sensitivity to sequence patterns common in modular enzyme architectures. These enzymes share common domain structures with repeated modules for substrate incorporation.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to modular biosynthetic enzymes involved in secondary metabolism, particularly non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.",

  "description": "This feature detects sequence patterns characteristic of modular biosynthetic enzymes, particularly non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and related multi-domain synthetases. The activation pattern shows distributed spikes throughout these large genes rather than at boundaries, suggesting the feature recognizes repeated structural elements or conserved catalytic domains common in these enzymes. These enzymes are responsible for synthesizing secondary metabolites including antibiotics and other bioactive compounds. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial genomes, appearing in the solG NRPS of Xenorhabdus, amino acid adenylation domains in Frankia, and similar large biosynthetic genes in other bacteria. The feature likely captures conserved sequence patterns associated with the modular architecture of these enzymes, which typically contain multiple catalytic domains arranged in assembly-line fashion.",
