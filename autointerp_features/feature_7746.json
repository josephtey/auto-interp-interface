  "reasoning": "I examined activation patterns across multiple bacterial genome examples from CFB group bacteria, focusing on identifying common elements where strong feature activation occurs. I noticed a highly consistent pattern where activation peaks appear at or near RagB/SusD family proteins in all examples. These proteins are annotated in various ways (RagB/SusD, SusD family, SusD domain-containing) but represent the same protein family, which is involved in polysaccharide uptake in Bacteroidetes.",
  "findings": "In all 7 examples, the strongest activation coincides precisely with genes encoding RagB/SusD family proteins, which are typically paired with TonB-dependent receptors (SusC family) in Bacteroidetes genomes. These proteins form polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) essential for carbohydrate uptake. The feature activates specifically at the 3' end of genomic regions where these proteins are encoded. Associated upstream genes often include glycoside hydrolases, sulfatases, and other carbohydrate-processing enzymes typical of PUL operons.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects RagB/SusD family proteins across multiple Bacteroidetes genomes with high specificity and consistency.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects RagB/SusD family proteins, which are outer membrane lipoproteins that bind carbohydrates in Bacteroidetes bacteria. The feature activates at the 3' end of the genes encoding these proteins. RagB/SusD proteins are key components of polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), functioning with TonB-dependent receptors (SusC) to bind and import complex carbohydrates. The pattern is remarkably consistent across all examples from various Bacteroidetes species (Zhouia, Pedobacter, Mongoliitalea, Flagellimonas, Cellulophaga), highlighting the evolutionary conservation of these important nutrient acquisition systems in this bacterial phylum.",
