  "reasoning": "I examined the patterns of feature activation across all examples, focusing on the genomic context where high activation consistently occurs. In each case, I noted the specific location of activation peaks relative to annotated genomic elements, looking for patterns in gene families, functional elements, or sequence contexts.",
  "findings": "A striking pattern emerged across all examples: the feature consistently shows strong activation at the 3' end of genomic regions, typically spanning 1-2kb in length. This activation appears immediately before specific types of membrane-related proteins. Particularly notable are activations near genes encoding outer membrane proteins (especially OmpA family in sections 1, 2, and 3), TonB-dependent receptors (sections 3, 5, 7, 9), SusC/RagA family proteins (sections 0, 5, 7), and other membrane-associated transport proteins. The activation pattern is consistently at the terminal region of genomic segments, suggesting it may identify a sequence motif or structural element at these boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects terminal regions of bacterial genomic segments adjacent to membrane protein genes, likely representing a conserved sequence signature or regulatory element associated with these proteins.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects the terminal regions of bacterial genomic segments that precede genes encoding membrane-associated proteins. The activation consistently appears as a strong signal at the 3' end of genomic fragments, with highest intensity just before genes encoding outer membrane proteins (particularly OmpA family), TonB-dependent receptors, and SusC/RagA family transporters. This suggests the feature may be identifying a conserved sequence motif, promoter region, or structural element that serves as a genomic boundary marker adjacent to membrane protein genes. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial genomes, indicating it represents a fundamental genomic organization principle related to membrane protein expression or integration. The biological function may involve transcriptional regulation, translation efficiency, or protein folding/trafficking signals for membrane proteins.",
