  "reasoning": "I analyzed activation patterns across all 10 examples, noting their distribution, intensity, and correlation with genomic elements. I observed that 9/10 examples are from Haliangium ochraceum DSM 14365, suggesting species-specificity. The activation appears as regular, evenly distributed spike patterns throughout most regions in the genome, rather than at specific gene boundaries or regulatory regions.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates in regular, high-intensity spike patterns throughout the Haliangium ochraceum genome, regardless of the underlying gene content. This pattern appears to represent a species-specific genomic signature rather than responding to specific functional elements like promoters, terminators, or specific gene families. The spike pattern maintains similar amplitude and distribution across different genomic regions, suggesting it detects an intrinsic sequence property specific to this organism.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects a genome-wide sequence property specific to Haliangium ochraceum rather than a functional genomic element.",

  "description": "This feature detects a genomic signature specific to Haliangium ochraceum DSM 14365, a myxobacterium. Rather than responding to specific functional elements, it activates in regular spike patterns distributed throughout the genome regardless of gene content. The feature responds with similar intensity patterns across diverse genomic regions containing different functional genes (secretion systems, metabolic enzymes, cell division components, etc.). This likely represents detection of species-specific sequence composition, codon usage bias, or other fundamental genomic properties unique to this organism. The pattern is extremely consistent across 9/10 examples from this species, with the only outlier being from Ferrovibrio terrae, which shows significantly different activation.",
