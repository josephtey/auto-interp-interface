  "reasoning": "I analyzed the feature activation patterns across multiple bacterial genomes, focusing on the genomic context where strong activation peaks occur. I identified a clear pattern where the feature consistently activates at or near ankyrin repeat domain-containing proteins in various bacterial species. In all examples, the feature shows strong activation (5-10 units) at these specific locations, with the activation pattern appearing as a continuous block rather than isolated spikes.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong and consistent activation at ankyrin repeat domain-containing proteins across diverse bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Fusobacteria. These proteins were annotated as \"ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein,\" \"Ankyrin repeats,\" or \"aNKYR\" in examples 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The feature activation pattern is remarkably specific to these ankyrin-containing regions. Ankyrin repeat proteins are important mediators of protein-protein interactions that play roles in various cellular processes, including signaling and structural organization.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably identifies ankyrin repeat domain-containing proteins across diverse bacterial genomes, representing a biologically meaningful pattern with functional significance.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects ankyrin repeat domain-containing proteins in bacterial genomes. The activation consistently occurs directly over the gene encoding the ankyrin repeat protein and manifests as a strong, continuous activation block rather than isolated peaks. Ankyrin repeat proteins mediate protein-protein interactions and are involved in multiple cellular functions including signaling pathways and structural organization. They are particularly interesting in bacteria as some can interface with eukaryotic host proteins during infection. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple examples and diverse bacterial taxa including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Fusobacteria, suggesting this is a conserved and important genomic element recognized by the model.",
