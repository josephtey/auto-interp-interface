{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each genomic region where the feature showed strong activation, looking for patterns in the activation location relative to gene annotations. I observed the feature consistently appears as a sharp, single spike with high activation values (3-4) across diverse bacterial species. The spike consistently appears near specific gene boundaries or gene transitions.",
  "findings": "In all examples, the activation spike occurs at or very near gene boundaries - most often at the junction between two genes or near the end of a gene. The feature appears in diverse bacterial taxa including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and CFB group bacteria. While the genes surrounding the activation sites vary, the positional pattern is extremely consistent. This suggests the feature is detecting a sequence motif common to gene transitions or terminations rather than specific gene content.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely detects a sequence motif associated with gene boundaries that may be involved in transcription termination or gene transition signals across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects a sequence motif that appears to be located at bacterial gene boundaries, particularly at the end of genes or between adjacent genes. The high specificity and consistency of the activation pattern across diverse bacterial species suggests it recognizes a conserved sequence element potentially involved in transcription termination or gene transition signaling. The motif appears functionally important as it occurs in different genomic contexts but maintains the same positional relationship relative to gene boundaries. The feature shows no taxonomic specificity, appearing in diverse bacterial phyla including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and CFB group bacteria, suggesting it recognizes a fundamental bacterial sequence element.",
