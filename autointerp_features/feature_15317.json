  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image carefully, focusing on the precise locations of activation peaks in relation to the genomic annotations. The most consistent pattern I observed was that the autoencoder feature strongly activates in regions where non-coding RNA elements are present, particularly at or near the boundaries of these elements. In examples where ncRNAs were annotated (images 5 and 8), the activation peaks aligned closely with these elements. In other examples, the activation appeared at positions that suggested structural RNA features even when not explicitly annotated as such.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently detects non-coding RNA structures in bacterial genomes. In example 5, the activation directly corresponds to tRNA elements (trnL and trnN). In example 8, the feature activates precisely at the end boundary of a small non-coding RNA (STnc450). In example 1, it detects the 5S ribosomal RNA. When no explicit ncRNA annotations are present, the activations occur at genomic locations that are likely to contain structural RNA elements or RNA-based regulatory features. The sharp, distinct activation peaks suggest this feature is detecting specific sequence or structural motifs common in non-coding RNAs rather than general transcriptional elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs, rRNAs, and small regulatory RNAs.",

  "description": "This feature detects non-coding RNA elements in bacterial genomes, with particular sensitivity to structured RNAs like tRNAs, rRNAs, and small regulatory RNAs. The feature activates precisely at the boundaries of these elements, suggesting it's detecting specific sequence or structural motifs characteristic of RNA termini or junction points. In the first example, it activates at the 5S rRNA (rrf); in example 5, it aligns with tRNA elements; and in example 8, it marks the boundary of the STnc450 sRNA. The consistent spike-like activation pattern suggests this feature recognizes specific sequence signatures that define functional non-coding RNAs, potentially capturing conserved elements involved in RNA processing, folding, or interactions with proteins. This pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial genomes, indicating the feature has identified evolutionarily conserved RNA structural elements.",
