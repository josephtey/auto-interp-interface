{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the genomic features where activation peaks occurred across all examples, identifying a consistent pattern related to outer membrane protein assembly complexes. I noted that in multiple examples, the feature strongly activates near genes like TamB, BamA, OMA87, and other membrane assembly components.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently detects bacterial outer membrane assembly machinery, specifically the Tam/Bam complexes. In 7 of 10 examples, strong activation peaks directly align with TamB (Translocation and Assembly Module B) or BamA (Beta-barrel Assembly Machinery A) genes. These complexes are essential for outer membrane protein insertion and folding in Gram-negative bacteria. The activation pattern shows specificity for these genes across diverse bacterial phyla.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a highly specific and biologically meaningful pattern of bacterial outer membrane protein assembly components.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects bacterial outer membrane protein assembly complexes, particularly genes encoding TamB and BamA components. These proteins form essential machinery for translocating and assembling outer membrane proteins in Gram-negative bacteria. The feature shows consistent strong activation directly over these genes, with a preference for the TamB gene based on activation intensity. The pattern is remarkably consistent across diverse bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria and CFB group, suggesting the feature has captured evolutionarily conserved sequence characteristics of these membrane assembly components. This detection capability likely reflects the biological importance of these complexes in maintaining bacterial envelope integrity.",
