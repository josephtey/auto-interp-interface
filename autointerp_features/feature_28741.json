  "reasoning": "I analyzed the feature activation patterns across multiple bacterial and archaeal genomes, examining the relationship between activation peaks and annotated genes. I looked for consistent patterns in activation strength, location relative to gene features, and biological function of the annotated elements.",
  "findings": "The feature shows distributed activation patterns with multiple spikes throughout coding sequences, particularly in genes related to nucleic acid metabolism. It consistently activates across DEAD/DEAH box helicases (sections 4 and 6), with additional activation in genes encoding other DNA-interacting proteins like transposases, methyltransferases, and nucleases. The activation pattern is distributed rather than focused on specific motifs, suggesting detection of broader sequence characteristics common to nucleic acid-binding proteins.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to DNA/RNA-interacting protein coding sequences.",

  "description": "This feature detects sequences encoding proteins that interact with nucleic acids, particularly helicases and related enzymes. It shows distributed activation throughout coding regions of DEAD/DEAH box helicases, transposases, and DNA-modifying enzymes. The pattern suggests recognition of codon usage or amino acid composition characteristic of nucleic acid-binding domains rather than specific motifs. The feature is highly consistent across bacterial examples, with greatest activation in genes with ATP-dependent helicase activity. This likely represents detection of conserved structural elements in genes encoding machinery for DNA/RNA manipulation, regardless of bacterial taxonomy.",
