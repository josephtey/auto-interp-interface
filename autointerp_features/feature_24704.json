  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all provided examples, noting the consistent spike-like activations that appear to be highly specific and precise. I observed the genomic context and annotation details around each activation site, looking for common features or patterns.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp, single-point activation spikes that occur at specific positions rather than broader regions. In almost all examples, these activations appear at gene boundaries or transition points between different genes. The activations don't show preference for specific gene types but rather for junctional regions in the genome. This suggests the feature detects sequence motifs that may be involved in gene transitions or regulatory elements at these boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures biologically meaningful patterns related to gene boundary regions or potential regulatory elements at gene transitions.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific sequence motifs that appear at gene boundaries or transition points between different coding sequences. The activation consistently presents as sharp, single spikes at these junction points rather than broad regions covering entire genes. The feature doesn't show specificity to particular gene types or functions, but rather to the transitional regions themselves, suggesting it may identify conserved sequence elements involved in gene separation, transcriptional regulation, or other boundary-defining functions. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial species including Proteobacteria (Gamma, Beta) and Actinobacteria, indicating it may represent a fundamental bacterial genome organizational element. This boundary-detection function appears taxonomically widespread rather than organism-specific.",
