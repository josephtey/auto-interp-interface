  "reasoning": "I examined the spike patterns across 10 genomic examples, looking for consistent patterns of activation in relation to annotated genes. I noted each activation location was a very distinct, sharp spike rather than a broad region of activity. I identified which genes were consistently present near or at the activation site.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, sharp activation spikes that consistently appear at or near intergenic regions between specific pairs of genes. Most notably, the spike frequently appears at or near tRNA genes and RNA-related features (section_2, section_6, section_7), or at positions between conserved gene pairs (groL/groES in section_2 and section_0). The feature does not appear to target specific gene content but rather specific positions that may represent transcriptional control points or RNA processing sites. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent - always a sharp spike at seemingly precise genomic positions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a specific, biologically meaningful pattern related to RNA processing or transcriptional boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific intergenic positions that frequently contain tRNA genes or appear at transcriptional boundaries between conserved gene pairs. The activation consistently manifests as a sharp spike at precise genomic locations rather than broad regions, suggesting it detects a specific sequence motif or structural element rather than gene content. Notably, in section_6, it activates precisely at the phenylalanine leader peptide (pheM) position, and in section_2 at tRNA positions. This pattern suggests the feature may detect RNA processing sites, transcriptional terminators, promoters, or other regulatory elements involved in RNA metabolism. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple bacterial species (enterobacteria, proteobacteria), indicating it represents a well-conserved bacterial genomic element.",
