  "reasoning": "I examined each image, focusing on the relationship between feature activation peaks and genomic annotations. I identified patterns in where activation occurs in relation to specific genomic elements, considering both the precise location and strength of activation. I tracked elements that appeared repeatedly across multiple examples to establish consistent patterns.",
  "findings": "Across all examples, the feature consistently activates as a sharp spike at or near tRNA genes or RNA-related elements. In section_9.png, activation occurs near trnP (tRNA-Pro); in section_7.png, near trnT (tRNA-Thr); in section_2.png, near trnI (tRNA-Ile); in section_5.png, near a CRISPR spacer element. Other examples show activation patterns that likely correspond to non-annotated RNA elements. The spike is always sharp and distinct, with high activation values (0.75-1.0), suggesting strong detection of a specific RNA structure or sequence motif.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically significant pattern related to specific RNA elements, particularly tRNA genes and other structured RNA features.",

  "description": "This feature detects tRNA genes and possibly other structured RNA elements in bacterial genomes. The activation pattern is characterized by a sharp, high-magnitude spike precisely at the position of tRNA genes or RNA elements. The consistent detection across different genomes suggests the feature recognizes a conserved structural or sequence motif common to these RNA elements. The biological significance likely relates to the critical role these RNAs play in translation and other cellular processes. The pattern appears highly consistent, with the feature activating strongly for tRNA-Pro, tRNA-Thr, tRNA-Ile, and near CRISPR spacers, which all share structured RNA characteristics.",
