  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all examples in relation to nearby genomic annotations. I noticed that in every case, the feature shows strong, sharp activation spikes that consistently appear at specific locations relative to genes. The feature doesn't show continuous activation across regions but rather precise single point activations.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at gene boundaries or junctions. Specifically, it appears to detect the 3' end (termination region) of coding sequences or the intergenic regions immediately following a gene's end. This pattern is evident in all examples where strong activation occurs precisely at or just after the end of a gene annotation. The feature is particularly active in Spiroplasma and other bacterial genomes, suggesting a taxon-specific signal related to gene termination structures.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with gene termination sites or intergenic regions following genes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects the 3' end of genes or the intergenic regions immediately following gene termination sites. It shows consistent, sharp activation spikes precisely at these boundaries across multiple examples. The signal likely corresponds to sequence motifs associated with transcription termination, such as rho-independent terminators or other termination signal sequences. The pattern is highly consistent across examples and appears most active in bacterial genomes, particularly in Spiroplasma species. The feature may be detecting conserved sequence patterns that signal the end of transcription units, which would have important regulatory functions in determining where RNA polymerase detaches from the DNA template.",
