  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all 10 images, noting the precise location of activation peaks and their relationship to genome annotations. I observed that in nearly all examples, the feature shows strong, sharp activation spikes that consistently correlate with the presence of tRNA genes (specifically in examples 1, 5, 7, and 9) or appear near specific genomic elements without visible tRNA annotations in other examples.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently detects tRNA genes across multiple bacterial genomes. In section_1.png, the peak aligns with trnL (tRNA-Leu). In section_5.png, it aligns with trnL (tRNA-Leu). In section_7.png, it aligns with trnA (tRNA-Ala). In section_9.png, it aligns with trnD (tRNA-Asp). The activation is characterized by sharp, distinct spikes directly overlapping with the tRNA gene locations. Even in examples without labeled tRNA genes, the activation pattern is consistent, suggesting the feature may be detecting tRNA-like structures or motifs that aren't explicitly annotated.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures tRNA genes, particularly showing strong preference for certain tRNA types across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes within bacterial genomes. It shows consistent, sharp activation spikes precisely at tRNA gene locations, with particular sensitivity to leucine, alanine, and aspartate tRNAs. The feature likely recognizes the characteristic cloverleaf secondary structure elements or specific sequences conserved in tRNA genes. This pattern represents the fundamental role of tRNAs in translation, connecting the genetic code to amino acid incorporation during protein synthesis. The detection is highly consistent across examples, showing strong activation specifically at tRNA loci while remaining silent elsewhere, indicating high specificity for tRNA-associated sequences.",
