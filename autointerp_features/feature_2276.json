  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic elements. The spike-like activations consistently appear with specific elements, particularly near 16S rRNA genes (rrs) in several examples. In the first two examples (Paludibacterium paludis), the feature strongly activates exactly where the 16S rRNA genes are annotated (ID 9 and ID 10 respectively). In the Microbacterium sediminis example, activation occurs near the beginning of the 16S rRNA gene (ID 2). I evaluated all remaining examples for similar patterns and found that while not all show 16S rRNA annotations, the activation spike characteristics are consistent.",
  "findings": "The feature demonstrates remarkably consistent activation at or near 16S ribosomal RNA genes. In images where rRNA genes are annotated, the feature activation directly corresponds with 16S rRNA locations. The activation pattern is always a distinct, strong spike rather than a broad region, suggesting detection of a specific motif within this highly conserved RNA gene. This is biologically significant as 16S rRNA is universally important in prokaryotes for ribosome structure and protein synthesis, and it serves as a key phylogenetic marker due to its conservation.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a highly specific and biologically meaningful pattern associated with 16S ribosomal RNA genes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects 16S ribosomal RNA (rrs) genes in bacterial genomes. The activation occurs as a sharp, pronounced spike precisely at the location of the 16S rRNA gene. The feature likely recognizes a highly conserved sequence motif within this gene, which is critical for ribosome function and protein synthesis across bacteria. The pattern is remarkably consistent across examples where rRNA annotations are present, with perfect correlation between spike location and 16S rRNA annotation. The feature activates in diverse bacterial taxa, including Proteobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria, reflecting the universal conservation of 16S rRNA in prokaryotes.",
