  "reasoning": "I analyzed all 10 examples, noting each activation peak's location relative to genomic annotations. I observed that most peaks occur directly at or near specific RNA elements - particularly tRNAs and non-coding RNAs - or in regions where RNA structural elements are likely present.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at locations containing tRNAs (examples 0, 6, 9) or non-coding RNA elements (example 5: L31-Actinobacteria ribosomal protein leader; example 1: S15-Flavobacteria ribosomal protein leader). In examples without annotated RNA elements, the activations still occur in intergenic regions where RNA structures may form. The activation signal consistently shows as a sharp, narrow spike rather than broad coverage, suggesting detection of specific motifs rather than gene regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects structured RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and ribosomal RNA leaders across bacterial genomes.",
  "title": "tRNA and structured RNA element detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNAs and structured non-coding RNA elements such as ribosomal protein leaders. The activation consistently appears as a sharp spike directly at the RNA element's location, not extending into flanking regions. These RNA structures play critical roles in translation regulation and other cellular processes. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial examples, from Firmicutes to Proteobacteria to Actinobacteria, suggesting the feature detects a conserved structural or sequence motif common to structured RNAs rather than species-specific elements.",
