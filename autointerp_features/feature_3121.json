{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the feature activation patterns across each genomic region, looking at the precise location of sharp activation spikes and their relationship to nearby genetic elements. I noticed that the activations consistently appeared as sharp, single spikes near or at transfer RNA (tRNA) locations.",
  "findings": "In example #0, the spike aligns exactly with annotated tRNA-Phe (ID 13). In several other examples, spikes occur in regions that neighbor ribosomal components or translational machinery (rplA in example #4, rpmF in example #7, rpsF in example #1, etc.). The feature's precise, localized activation pattern suggests it's detecting a specific sequence motif common to tRNAs or regions involved in translation. The spikes are consistently strong and narrowly defined, indicating high specificity for this element.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to tRNA elements or related translational machinery.",

  "description": "This feature detects transfer RNA (tRNA) sequences and potentially other translation-related elements. The activation pattern shows sharp, discrete spikes precisely at or near tRNA locations (as seen directly with tRNA-Phe in example #0) and near ribosomal protein genes in other examples. The consistent spike pattern suggests the feature recognizes a specific sequence motif common to tRNAs or their promoters. This detection is biologically significant as tRNAs are essential components of protein translation, delivering amino acids to ribosomes. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, showing the same sharp, localized activation profile in each case.",
