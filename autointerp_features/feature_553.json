  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, focusing on their relationships to specific genomic annotations. I identified a consistent pattern where strong activation signals appear either at or near tRNA genes or CRISPR elements. In examples where tRNAs are present (sections 1 and 4), the feature shows strong activation directly at tRNA locations. In examples containing CRISPR elements (sections 3 and 8), activation coincides with CRISPR repeats/spacers. This suggests the feature detects non-coding RNA structural elements rather than protein-coding genes.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at non-coding RNA elements across bacterial genomes. In section 1, strong activation occurs at tRNA-Tyr. In section 4, activation coincides with tRNA-Pro. In sections 3 and 8, activation appears at CRISPR repeat regions. The activation pattern shows distinct peaks with high intensity (values 4-7) at these elements, while remaining inactive elsewhere in the genome. This indicates the feature is detecting shared structural or sequence characteristics common to non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and CRISPR repeats.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects non-coding RNA structural elements across diverse bacterial genomes, particularly tRNAs and CRISPR repeats.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects structured non-coding RNA elements, primarily tRNAs and CRISPR repeats. It shows strong, localized activation directly at these elements, suggesting sensitivity to shared structural characteristics like stem-loops or other secondary structures common in these functional RNAs. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial phyla (including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetes), indicating a fundamental recognition of RNA structural motifs that transcend taxonomic boundaries. The feature likely captures conserved sequence or structural signatures that are critical for the function of these non-coding RNAs in processes like translation and bacterial immunity.",
