{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed multiple examples of feature activations across different bacterial genomes, looking for patterns in where activations occur relative to specific genes, the consistency of these activations, and any biological relationships between annotated features at activation sites.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong spike-like activations around or within cobalamin (vitamin B12) related genes and regulatory elements. Several examples show activation near cobN (cobaltochelatase) genes, cobalamin riboswitches, or transport systems for cobalt/cobalamin precursors. In multiple examples, the activation appears just before or within ABC transporters involved in iron/cobalt uptake, which are essential for cobalamin synthesis. The feature also activates near genes involved in related metabolic pathways that utilize cobalamin as a cofactor.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects genomic elements related to cobalamin metabolism and regulation across different bacterial taxa.",
  "title": "Cobalamin-associated genomic element detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects genomic regions associated with cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolism, particularly: - Genes encoding cobaltochelatase (cobN) which inserts cobalt into the corrin ring during cobalamin synthesis - Cobalamin riboswitches that regulate gene expression in response to B12 levels - ABC-type transporters for cobalt/iron acquisition necessary for cobalamin synthesis - The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacteria (firmicutes, proteobacteria) - The activation appears as a sharp spike typically at the junction between, or within, key cobalamin-related genes - This likely represents detection of conserved sequence motifs involved in B12 metabolism regulation across bacterial phyla",
