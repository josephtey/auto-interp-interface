  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation pattern across all examples to identify a consistent genomic element or context associated with the strong spike-like activation. In each image, I observed a sharp activation spike at a specific genome position and examined the surrounding genomic annotations to determine what biological feature might be triggering this activation. I looked for recurring patterns in terms of proximity to specific gene types, regulatory elements, or non-coding RNAs.",
  "findings": "The most consistent pattern observed is that the activation spike frequently appears near non-coding RNA elements, particularly ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or riboswitch regions. In examples where these elements are present (sections 4, 5, 9), the feature shows strong activation. Additionally, in other examples where non-coding RNA is not annotated, the activation occurs at intergenic regions that could potentially contain unannotated regulatory RNA elements. The feature shows sharp, localized activation rather than broad patterns, suggesting it detects a specific sequence motif or structural element rather than gene families or broader genomic contexts.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to non-coding RNA elements or specific sequence motifs associated with RNA regulatory regions.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects sequence patterns associated with non-coding RNA elements, particularly 5S ribosomal RNA and riboswitches. The feature consistently shows sharp, localized activation spikes directly over or immediately adjacent to these RNA elements. In examples where rRNA is annotated (sections 5, 9), the activation peak aligns precisely with these regions. In other examples without explicit RNA annotations, the activation occurs at intergenic locations that likely contain similar sequence motifs. This pattern suggests the feature recognizes specific sequence signatures characteristic of structured RNA elements, which are crucial for translation regulation and other cellular RNA processing functions. The consistency of the spike pattern and its association with RNA elements across diverse bacterial genomes indicates this feature captures an evolutionarily conserved RNA-associated sequence motif.",
