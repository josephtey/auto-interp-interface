{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across 10 genomic examples, noting that each shows a distinct, sharp spike of activation at a specific position. I examined the locations of these spikes relative to annotated genomic features, looking for consistent patterns in gene types, positioning, or genomic context.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, singular spikes at sequence junctions between genes. There is no consistent association with specific gene types or families across examples. Instead, the activation appears to be detecting intergenic regions, particularly those between genes oriented in either the same or opposite directions, suggesting a possible role in detecting gene boundaries or transition points in the genome.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect sequence characteristics associated with intergenic regions and gene boundaries across diverse bacterial species.",

  "description": "This feature consistently detects intergenic regions and gene boundaries across diverse bacterial species. The activation pattern shows sharp, discrete spikes at locations between annotated genes, regardless of gene function. The feature appears agnostic to the specific genes involved, instead recognizing sequence characteristics that mark transitions between coding regions. This pattern is consistent across different bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, suggesting it may detect universal sequence signatures associated with gene boundaries rather than taxon-specific elements. Given its consistent firing at intergenic junctions, this feature likely recognizes regulatory elements, terminators, promoters, or specific nucleotide compositions characteristic of intergenic spaces.",
