  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify common patterns between the feature activation peaks and genomic annotations. Each image shows a single, sharp activation spike, suggesting the feature detects a specific sequence element rather than broad regions. I compared the spike locations with gene annotations to determine what genomic context consistently appears at these positions.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at gene boundaries, particularly at the end of one gene and the beginning of another. In almost all examples, the activation spike occurs precisely at or near the transition point between coding sequences. This pattern appears across diverse bacterial phyla (\u03b1-proteobacteria, Firmicutes, CFB group, high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, Mycoplasmas), suggesting it detects a fundamental genomic feature rather than a taxon-specific element. The activation is highly specific with a sharp, well-defined peak, indicating recognition of a precise sequence motif or structural element that occurs at gene boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects intergenic regions, specifically gene boundaries, across diverse bacterial taxa.",

  "description": "This feature detects the transition points between adjacent genes in bacterial genomes. It consistently activates at intergenic boundaries with sharp, well-defined spikes that mark the precise location where one gene ends and another begins. The feature appears to recognize sequence characteristics typical of bacterial gene junctions, such as terminators, promoters, or other regulatory elements that occur in these regions. The pattern is remarkably consistent across diverse bacterial phyla (including \u03b1-proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Mollicutes), suggesting it captures a fundamental property of bacterial genome organization rather than taxon-specific elements. This feature may be detecting signals related to transcription termination and initiation, ribosome binding sites, or other regulatory motifs that define gene boundaries in bacteria.",
