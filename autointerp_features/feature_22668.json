  "reasoning": "I examined the 10 genomic examples, focusing on when and where feature activation spikes occurred. Each example shows a single sharp spike with high activation values (4-6). The pattern is remarkably consistent - the spike always appears at junctions between genes or specific genomic elements. I analyzed the annotations proximal to each activation peak and looked for pattern consistency across all examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at intergenic junctions where regulatory transitions likely occur. Notably, in several examples (sections 9, 3, 6), the activation coincides with non-coding RNA elements (6S-Flavo RNA, tRNA, CRISPR repeats) or their boundaries. In other examples, the spike appears at transitions between genes with different functions or orientations. The activation doesn't appear to target specific gene families but rather the boundaries or transition points in genomic organization.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect intergenic boundaries and regulatory transition points in bacterial genomes, particularly where non-coding RNA elements interface with coding sequences.",

  "description": "This feature detects genomic transition points, particularly focusing on: - Boundaries between genes or intergenic regions - Junctions where non-coding RNA elements (tRNAs, CRISPR repeats, regulatory RNAs) interface with coding regions - Points where gene orientation changes or regulatory regions begin/end - Transition zones that may represent regulatory switches between functional units The consistently sharp, high-amplitude activation pattern across diverse bacterial genomes suggests this feature identifies fundamental structural elements in genome organization related to transcriptional regulation and genetic unit boundaries. The detection of these transition points likely serves important roles in predicting regulatory relationships between adjacent genomic elements.",
