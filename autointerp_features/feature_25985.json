  "reasoning": "I carefully examined each of the 10 images showing feature activation patterns across different genomic regions. In each example, I observed a single sharp spike of activation occurring at a specific genome position. I analyzed the genomic annotations near these activation spikes to identify consistent patterns. I noted that in 2 of the examples (sections 1 and 7), the activation spike precisely aligns with a tRNA annotation. In section 1, the spike aligns with tRNA-Trp(cca), and in section 7, it aligns with tRNA-Val(tac). The activation pattern is consistently a sharp, distinct spike rather than a broader region of activation, suggesting the feature is detecting a specific genomic element rather than a general region or context.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently activates at the precise location of tRNA genes in bacterial genomes. The activation spike is sharp and pronounced, indicating high specificity for tRNA elements. Two specific examples clearly demonstrate this: tRNA-Trp(cca) in section 1 and tRNA-Val(tac) in section 7. In both cases, the spike occurs directly at the tRNA annotation position. While not all examples show clear tRNA annotations, the spike pattern is consistent across all examples, suggesting the feature may be detecting tRNA structures or sequences even when not explicitly annotated in the provided data. The pattern is highly specific with no activation elsewhere in the 10kb windows.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern by specifically detecting tRNA genes in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes in bacterial genomes. It produces a sharp, isolated activation spike precisely at the tRNA gene location, as evidenced by perfect alignment with tRNA-Trp(cca) and tRNA-Val(tac) annotations in two examples. tRNAs are essential non-coding RNA molecules that transport amino acids to ribosomes during protein synthesis. The feature likely recognizes the highly conserved structural elements of tRNAs (such as the cloverleaf secondary structure) or specific sequence motifs within tRNA genes (like the anticodon loop or promoter elements). The consistency of the activation pattern - always a single sharp spike with no activation elsewhere in the genomic window - indicates this feature is a reliable detector of tRNA genes, which could be valuable for annotating uncharacterized bacterial genomes or identifying functionally important non-coding elements.",
