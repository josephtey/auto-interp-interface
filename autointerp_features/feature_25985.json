  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify precise activation patterns in relation to genomic annotations. I focused on the positioning, strength, and consistency of activation spikes across different organisms, noting their relationship to specific genomic elements. In each case, the feature shows a sharp, single-point activation spike at very specific locations within each genome.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at or near tRNA genes, particularly tRNA-Leu, as seen in section_1.png where activation occurs directly at trnL (tRNA-Leu). In other examples without explicit tRNA annotations, the feature appears at intergenic regions or boundaries that likely contain small RNA elements. The sharp, localized nature of the activation suggests recognition of a specific sequence motif rather than a broader gene class or family.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with tRNA genes or similar structural RNA elements.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif associated with tRNA genes, particularly tRNA-Leu, as explicitly seen in section_1.png. The feature produces a sharp, isolated activation spike precisely at the tRNA location or at positions likely containing unannotated tRNA or similar small RNA structures. The consistency of the activation pattern\u2014always a single sharp spike rather than broader activation\u2014suggests recognition of a highly specific sequence element rather than general gene regions. This likely represents detection of a conserved promoter element, structural motif, or processing site associated with tRNA genes. The pattern appears across diverse bacterial phyla, indicating the detected element is phylogenetically widespread and evolutionarily conserved among prokaryotes.",
