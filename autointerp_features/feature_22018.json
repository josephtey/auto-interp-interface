  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify strong activation patterns and their relationship to genome annotations. I noted the genomic elements present at or near activation peaks, examining both the type of elements (coding sequences, tRNAs, CRISPR components) and their specific functions. I then looked for consistent patterns across examples.",
  "findings": "The sparse autoencoder feature consistently activates at or near tRNA genes in multiple genomic contexts. In image 2, there's a strong activation peak near trnG (tRNA-Gly) and trnE (tRNA-Glu). In image 8, activation occurs near trnG (tRNA-Gly). In image 4, activation coincides with trnA (tRNA-Ala) and trnC (tRNA-Cys). Image 6 shows activation near trnM (tRNA-Met). In image 7, activation appears at C4 antisense RNA. The feature shows precise, sharp spike patterns typically at or very close to non-coding RNA features, particularly tRNAs. The consistent activation pattern suggests this feature is detecting sequence or structural motifs specific to tRNA genes or their promoter regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with tRNA genes and potentially other structured non-coding RNAs.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes across bacterial genomes, showing strong, precise activation spikes at tRNA loci. The feature activates at various tRNA types (Gly, Glu, Ala, Met, Cys) suggesting it's detecting a common structural element, promoter motif, or sequence characteristic shared among tRNAs rather than being specific to a particular tRNA type. tRNAs have distinctive cloverleaf secondary structures and conserved promoter elements that may be recognized by this feature. The pattern is highly consistent across examples with minimal activation elsewhere in the genome, indicating the feature is a reliable detector of tRNA genes and potentially other structured non-coding RNAs. This suggests biological significance in identifying translation-related functional elements in bacterial genomes.",
