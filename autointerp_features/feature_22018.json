  "reasoning": "I examined each image for patterns of activation, noting their relationship to genome annotations. I focused on identifying where peaks occur relative to genes, their intensity, and consistency across examples.",
  "findings": "The feature shows sharp, singular activation spikes at or near specific genes. In several examples (2, 5, 7), activation precisely aligns with purine riboswitch elements. In other examples (0, 6), peaks occur near genes involved in metabolic pathways (pyruvate metabolism, phosphate transfer). The feature shows consistent sharp activation rather than broad regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect specific non-coding RNA regulatory elements, particularly purine riboswitches, with high specificity.",

  "description": "This feature primarily detects purine riboswitches in bacterial genomes. The activation pattern shows sharp, distinct spikes precisely at the riboswitch location. Purine riboswitches are non-coding RNA elements that regulate gene expression by changing conformation upon binding to purine molecules like guanine. They typically control genes involved in purine metabolism and transport. The feature shows remarkable consistency as sharp, isolated peaks rather than broad activations. While most prominent in firmicutes, it appears to detect this regulatory element across diverse bacterial phyla, highlighting conservation of this regulatory mechanism.",
