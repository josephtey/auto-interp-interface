  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify the relationship between feature activation and genomic elements. Across examples, I observed that activation peaks consistently appear at transition points between genes, particularly between genes with transporter/membrane functions and adjacent genes. The feature appears to detect specific intergenic regions or potential regulatory boundaries in diverse bacterial species.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at gene boundaries in bacterial genomes, particularly at transitions involving transport-related proteins such as ABC transporters, permeases, efflux pumps, and membrane proteins. These sharp activation spikes occur precisely between genes rather than within coding regions, suggesting detection of intergenic regulatory elements or sequence motifs that mark boundaries between functionally related transport genes and neighboring genes. This pattern is consistent across multiple bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects intergenic boundaries adjacent to transport-related genes across diverse bacterial taxa, likely capturing a conserved regulatory or structural genomic signature.",

  "description": "This feature detects intergenic boundaries adjacent to transport-related genes in bacterial genomes. It activates with sharp, distinct spikes precisely at the transition points between transport-related genes (ABC transporters, permeases, efflux pumps) and neighboring genes. The feature doesn't activate within coding sequences but specifically at gene junctions, suggesting it may capture conserved intergenic regulatory elements, promoter regions, or sequence motifs that define functional boundaries. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria (alpha, beta) and Gram-positive bacteria, indicating an evolutionarily conserved genomic signature associated with transport gene organization.",
