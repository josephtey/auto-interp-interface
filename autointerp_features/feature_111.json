  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation relative to gene annotations. I observed consistent activation over specific transporter genes, particularly multidrug efflux systems. I tracked activation patterns across different bacterial genomes and noted the feature strongly activates over AcrB/AcrA/TolC components of RND-type efflux systems.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates over genes encoding multidrug efflux pump components, particularly the AcrB component. This is clearly visible in section_3 (Woeseia oceani), section_5 (Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii), and section_2 (Hirschia baltica). The activation spans the coding sequence of transporter proteins, with strongest signal over the AcrB/CusA component. In organisms without AcrB/AcrA, the feature activates over other transporter genes (TRAP transporters, xylulokinase, etc.), but with less intensity.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to bacterial multidrug efflux transport systems.",

  "description": "This feature detects bacterial RND-type multidrug efflux transporters, particularly the AcrB/CusA pump component. It shows strong continuous activation along the entire coding sequence of these genes, with highest intensity for the AcrB subunit. The feature also recognizes related transport systems (TRAP transporters, ABC transporters) with lower activation strength. The RND-type efflux systems are critical for bacterial antimicrobial resistance and toxin export. The pattern is highly consistent across proteobacterial examples (both alpha and gamma), suggesting evolutionary conservation of sequence characteristics in these transporters.",
