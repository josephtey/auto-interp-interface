  "reasoning": "I examined each example carefully, focusing on where the feature activates in relation to gene annotations. I noted activation patterns occur as sharp peaks at specific locations between or at specific regions within gene clusters. The activations primarily occur at intergenic regions or gene boundaries across bacterial genomes from different phyla.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at gene boundaries and intergenic regions between operons or gene clusters. Activation occurs particularly strongly at boundaries of functionally related gene clusters like cell division/peptidoglycan synthesis genes (murG/ftsW/murD in section_3), NADH oxidoreductase clusters (nuoA-nuoL in section_5), flagellar biosynthesis operons (flg/flh genes in section_8), and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes (lpxA/lpxB in section_1). The activation pattern appears as sharp, discrete spikes rather than broad regions, suggesting recognition of specific intergenic regulatory elements, possibly promoters or terminators.",
  "conclusion": "The feature detects bacterial operon boundary regions, particularly at functionally important gene clusters related to core cellular functions.",

  "description": "This feature detects intergenic regions at bacterial operon boundaries, particularly at transitions between functionally related gene clusters. It activates at the junctions between genes in important operons including cell division (mur/fts genes), energy metabolism (nuo genes), flagellar biosynthesis (flg/flh genes), and membrane biogenesis (lpx genes). The activation pattern manifests as sharp spikes rather than broad regions, suggesting detection of specific regulatory elements like promoters or terminators that define operon structure. The feature is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Dictyoglomi, indicating it captures a fundamental aspect of bacterial genome organization related to transcriptional regulation of polycistronic mRNAs.",
