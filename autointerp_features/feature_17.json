  "reasoning": "I carefully examined each image to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I looked for consistent positioning, strength, and genomic context across examples, paying attention to when and where strong activation spikes occurred in relation to specific genes or elements.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, I observed sharp, distinctive activation spikes strongly associated with transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. In examples where tRNAs are annotated (section_4, section_5, section_0), the feature activation shows clear, high-magnitude spikes at or near tRNA locations. In other examples without explicit tRNA annotations, the activation pattern shows similar sharp spikes that may correspond to unannotated tRNA genes or similar structural RNA elements. The activation specifically appears as distinct sharp spikes rather than broad regions, suggesting recognition of compact, highly structured elements like tRNAs.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently captures tRNA genes or similar structured RNA elements across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes across bacterial genomes. The activation pattern consistently shows sharp, high-magnitude spikes precisely at tRNA locations, as seen in examples with annotated tRNAs (tRNA-Gln in section_4, tRNA-Gly in section_5). The feature likely recognizes the distinctive structural characteristics of tRNAs, which are compact, highly conserved RNA elements with specific secondary structure. This pattern is biologically significant as tRNAs are essential for protein translation, carrying amino acids to ribosomes during translation. The detection is highly consistent across multiple bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria and other diverse bacterial lineages, suggesting the feature captures fundamental aspects of tRNA structure conserved across prokaryotes.",
