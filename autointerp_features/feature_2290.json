  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully, looking for consistent patterns in where the feature activates in relation to genomic annotations. The feature consistently shows sharp, high-intensity spike activations at specific positions. I noted each activation's position relative to the annotations and tracked what genomic elements were present near these activation sites.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at or very near the positions of annotated transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. This pattern appears in examples where tRNAs are clearly annotated (sections 3, 4, and 8 with trnV, trnR, and trnA respectively). In section_2, the feature activates near a 5S ribosomal RNA (rrf). These are all non-coding RNA genes. The activation shows as sharp, distinct spikes with high intensity (ranging from ~4-7.5 in magnitude) directly at the RNA gene locations. No consistent protein-coding gene (CDS) pattern is observed near activation sites.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures the presence of non-coding RNA genes, particularly tRNAs, with high specificity and consistency.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and other small non-coding RNA elements like 5S rRNA. The activation pattern is characterized by sharp, high-magnitude spikes precisely at the RNA gene location. The feature shows remarkable consistency, with strong activations at trnV (tRNA-Val), trnR (tRNA-Arg), trnA (tRNA-Ala), and 5S rRNA positions across different genomes. This suggests the feature recognizes conserved structural or sequence characteristics of these small RNA genes, which are critical for protein translation machinery. The pattern is highly consistent across examples and shows no activation in regions lacking RNA genes, indicating high specificity for these elements.",
