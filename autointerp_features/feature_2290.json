  "reasoning": "I examined each image for consistent patterns between feature activation and genomic annotations. In all 10 examples, I observed strong, sharp activation spikes precisely coinciding with tRNA-Ser genes. The activation shows sharp, high-amplitude peaks (values 4-8) exactly at tRNA-Ser locations regardless of the neighboring genes or organism type.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently detects tRNA-Ser genes across different bacterial phyla (proteobacteria, actinobacteria, firmicutes). The activation is highly specific to serine tRNAs with different anticodons (cga, gct, gga), showing no activation for other genomic elements. The specificity and consistency suggest this feature has specialized in detecting sequence or structural elements unique to serine tRNAs.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a highly specific and biologically meaningful pattern related to serine tRNA genes across diverse bacterial species.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA-Serine genes across diverse bacterial genomes. The activation shows consistent, sharp spikes precisely at the location of tRNA-Ser genes with different anticodons (cga, gct, gga). The feature likely recognizes the conserved structural or sequence elements unique to serine tRNAs. This pattern is extremely consistent across all examples and spans multiple bacterial phyla (proteobacteria, actinobacteria, firmicutes), suggesting the feature detects a fundamental aspect of tRNA-Ser that has been evolutionarily conserved. This represents a functionally significant detection of an essential component of bacterial translation machinery.",
