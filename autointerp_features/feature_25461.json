  "reasoning": "I examined each example closely, looking for consistent patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I observed that in all examples, the feature shows strong activation (peaks of 4-7 units) over non-coding RNA elements or in regions immediately adjacent to specific RNA-related genes. In several examples (sections 0, 5, 6, 9), the activation coincides with CRISPR spacers or tRNA/rRNA elements. The activation pattern is consistently a continuous block with a defined start and end rather than sporadic spikes.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently activates over non-coding RNA elements and RNA-processing genes across multiple bacterial species. In section 0, it activates over 23S rRNA; in section 5, over tRNA-Phe; in section 6, over tmRNA (ssrA); in section 9, over a CRISPR spacer. When not directly over these elements, the feature activates near genes involved in RNA metabolism or translation (ribosomal proteins, translation factors). The consistent activation pattern suggests detection of structured RNA elements or regions with specific RNA-related functions across diverse bacterial phyla.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects structured non-coding RNA elements and regions involved in RNA processing across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects regions containing structured non-coding RNA elements (tRNAs, rRNAs, CRISPR spacers, tmRNA) or genes involved in RNA processing and translation across bacterial genomes. The feature shows strong, continuous activation directly over these RNA elements or immediately adjacent to related genes. The consistent pattern across diverse bacteria (Firmicutes, Actinomycetes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria) suggests the feature recognizes a conserved structural or sequence characteristic common to functional RNA elements. This likely represents detection of RNA secondary structure motifs that have been conserved through bacterial evolution due to their functional importance in translation, RNA processing, or gene regulation.",
