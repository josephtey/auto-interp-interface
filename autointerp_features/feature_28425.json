  "reasoning": "I examined each visualization to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I focused on understanding where activation peaks appear in relation to coding sequences (cds) and their functions. I noted that strong activations consistently appear in GC-rich Streptomyces regions, typically covering specific protein genes.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently activates across extended regions (2-5kb) in high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, primarily Streptomyces ferrugineus. Activations typically span entire genes or gene clusters rather than specific binding sites. The most notable pattern is the feature's association with ATP-binding proteins, ATPases, kinases, and other energy-related proteins (sections 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8). There's also significant correlation with large protein-coding genes involved in transport, signaling, and regulation. The feature doesn't appear sequence-specific but rather detects broader compositional or structural properties of these GC-rich genomic regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures biologically meaningful patterns of GC-rich gene bodies in actinobacteria, particularly those encoding ATP-binding proteins and large functional proteins.",

  "description": "This feature detects extended regions of GC-rich coding sequences in Actinobacteria, particularly Streptomyces. It shows strong, continuous activation across gene bodies encoding ATP-binding proteins, transporters, regulatory proteins, and large functional enzymes. The pattern spans entire coding regions rather than specific motifs, suggesting sensitivity to compositional biases characteristic of high-GC organisms. This likely represents a fundamental property of protein-coding regions in GC-rich bacterial genomes. The feature is highly consistent across examples, almost exclusively activating in Streptomyces ferrugineus and related high-GC Gram-positive bacteria, indicating taxonomic specificity.",
