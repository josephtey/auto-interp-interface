  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example carefully, focusing on the location of the prominent spike-like activation patterns and their relationship to the annotated genomic features. I noted the position of each activation peak relative to nearby genes and other genomic elements, looking for consistent patterns across all examples. I examined the functional annotations of genes located near activation sites to identify potential biological significance.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, discrete spike activations at specific genomic locations. In most examples, these activation spikes appear at or near gene boundaries, particularly at gene starts or intergenic regions preceding genes. Several activation peaks occur close to genes involved in methionine metabolism (metK appears in sections 3 and 4), transcriptional regulation, or specific structural elements. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent as sharp, isolated spikes of high intensity rather than broad regions of activation.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern that likely represents a specific sequence motif or structural element at gene boundaries, potentially related to transcriptional regulation or translation initiation sites.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence or structural element that occurs preferentially at gene boundaries, particularly at the beginning of genes or in intergenic regions. The activation pattern shows consistent sharp spikes of high intensity at these locations across diverse bacterial genomes. The feature appears to recognize a motif potentially involved in gene regulation, possibly related to transcription initiation, ribosome binding sites, or other regulatory elements. The detection is highly specific and localized, suggesting recognition of a discrete sequence pattern rather than a broader genomic feature. This pattern may represent a conserved regulatory element across bacterial species, as it appears consistently across multiple genomes regardless of the specific genes present nearby.",
