  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify patterns in activation peaks, noting their positions relative to genome annotations. I compared activation patterns across examples to identify consistent genomic elements or contexts where the feature activates strongly. I paid attention to both the immediate activation site and surrounding genomic context to determine what specific genomic element this feature detects.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, I observed strong, consistent activation peaks near tRNA genes or at the boundary between genes involved in translation machinery. In section_8.png, the feature activates strongly near trnP (tRNA-Pro). In section_2.png, activation occurs near trnR (tRNA-Arg). When tRNAs aren't present, the feature tends to activate near gene boundaries, particularly where translation-related genes (like ribosomal proteins) or transcriptional regulators are located. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent - sharp, distinct spikes with high amplitude, suggesting recognition of a specific sequence motif rather than a broader genomic region or feature.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects tRNA genes or specific sequence motifs at gene boundaries, likely representing a functionally significant pattern related to translation machinery or transcriptional regulation boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes or boundaries between genes involved in translation processes. The activation consistently appears as sharp, high-amplitude spikes precisely at these elements. In examples where tRNAs are present (like trnR in section_2.png and trnP in section_8.png), the feature shows exceptionally strong activation. When tRNAs aren't annotated, the feature activates at gene boundaries, often involving ribosomal proteins or transcriptional regulators. This pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial phyla (proteobacteria, firmicutes, CFB group), suggesting the feature detects a universal bacterial sequence motif related to tRNA genes or specific transcriptional boundaries. This likely represents recognition of promoter elements, terminators, or special sequence motifs that mark these critical regions of the genome involved in the translation machinery.",
