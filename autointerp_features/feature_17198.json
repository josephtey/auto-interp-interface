  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example carefully, noting the position and strength of activation peaks in relation to nearby genomic annotations. In every case, I observed a sharp, strong spike-like activation pattern rather than continuous or broad activation. The spike consistently appears between genes rather than within coding sequences, suggesting it detects an intergenic element.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at precise intergenic locations. Looking at surrounding genes, there's significant diversity in gene function and organism type. The sharp, high-amplitude spikes (reaching values of 2.5-3.0) suggest detection of a specific sequence motif rather than a broad functional region. No consistent flanking gene pattern emerged, and the feature appears in diverse bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, CFB group). In several examples, tRNAs are annotated nearby (sections 6, 9, 3), suggesting possible relationship to RNA-related elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely detects a widespread bacterial intergenic sequence motif, possibly related to gene regulation or transcriptional boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific intergenic sequence motif present across diverse bacterial genomes. The activation occurs as sharp spikes (amplitude 2.5-3.0) in intergenic regions with no consistent relationship to specific gene types. The element appears in diverse bacterial phyla including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and CFB group bacteria. The precise, consistent nature of the activation pattern suggests detection of a specific sequence motif rather than a functional element class. This may represent a transcription factor binding site, a small RNA, or another regulatory element that functions independently of nearby gene identity.",
