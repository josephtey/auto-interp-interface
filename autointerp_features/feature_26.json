  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example closely, examining the activation peaks and their relationship to the genomic annotations. I identified a consistent pattern where strong activation occurs near or directly over specific types of genes in all examples.",
  "findings": "In all examples, the feature shows strong activation peaks specifically near or over tRNA synthetase genes (ligases) and related components. Particularly consistent are phenylalanine-tRNA ligase components (pheS/pheT) which appear in sections 6, 3, and 5. Other tRNA-related genes like valS and tilS also coincide with activations. The feature tends to activate at the beginning or within these genes. The pattern is conserved across diverse bacterial phyla including Firmicutes and Spirochetes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA synthetase genes, particularly phenylalanine-tRNA ligase components, across diverse bacteria.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects genes encoding tRNA synthetases (aminoacyl-tRNA ligases) and related components across bacterial genomes. It shows particularly strong activation for phenylalanine-tRNA ligase genes (pheS/pheT), which appear in multiple examples with consistent activation patterns. The feature typically fires at the beginning or within these genes, suggesting it may detect specific sequence motifs in their coding regions. This pattern is consistent across diverse bacterial phyla, including Firmicutes and Spirochetes, indicating evolutionary conservation of these essential protein synthesis components. The biological significance relates to protein translation machinery, specifically the enzymes that attach amino acids to their cognate tRNAs.",
