  "reasoning": "I examined each image, focusing on the sharp activation spikes and their genomic context. In multiple examples (0, 9, 2), the activation occurs precisely at tRNA gene clusters. The feature consistently shows strong, discrete activation spikes at or near tRNA gene locations across different bacterial and archaeal genomes.",
  "findings": "This feature specifically detects tRNA gene locations. In images 0 and 9, the activation peaks directly align with annotated tRNA clusters. The pattern is highly specific to tRNA genes regardless of the particular tRNA type (Leu, Ala, Ser, etc.) or the taxonomic origin of the organism. The activation is characterized by sharp, high-amplitude spikes that occur precisely at tRNA locations, suggesting the feature is detecting sequence or structural elements common to tRNA genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures tRNA gene locations across diverse organisms, representing a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically identifies tRNA genes across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes. The activation pattern shows sharp, high-amplitude spikes that precisely align with annotated tRNA gene positions. The feature appears agnostic to the specific tRNA type (amino acid specificity) and is conserved across phylogenetically distant organisms including proteobacteria, firmicutes, CFB group bacteria, and archaea. This likely represents detection of the conserved structural elements or sequence motifs characteristic of tRNA genes, such as the cloverleaf secondary structure or promoter elements. The consistent, specific activation pattern across diverse examples indicates this feature is a robust detector of these essential non-coding RNA genes involved in protein translation.",
