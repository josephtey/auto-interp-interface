  "reasoning": "I examined the 10 images showing feature activation patterns with their corresponding genomic annotations. I focused on identifying the precise locations where activation peaks occur and their relationship to specific genomic elements. For each example, I noted strong, discrete activations that appear as sharp spikes in the activation pattern. These consistently occur at or near tRNA genes (in section_5.png and section_7.png) or at intergenic regions between coding sequences without clear association to any specific gene type in the other examples.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, localized activation spikes that appear to detect non-coding RNA elements (particularly tRNAs) and potentially other specific DNA structural or sequence motifs at intergenic regions. In section_7.png, activation aligns with trnP (tRNA-Pro), and in section_5.png with trnL (tRNA-Leu). In other examples, activations occur at boundaries between genes or within intergenic regions. The consistent pattern is a sharp, isolated spike rather than broad activation across gene bodies, suggesting detection of a specific sequence motif or structural element common in non-coding regions, particularly those associated with RNA genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with tRNA genes and potentially other non-coding structural elements at intergenic regions.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence or structural motif associated with tRNA genes and certain intergenic regions. The feature consistently shows sharp, isolated activation spikes rather than broad patterns across gene bodies. When tRNA genes are present (as in section_5.png and section_7.png), activation occurs directly at their location. The biological function likely involves detection of promoter elements, specific RNA gene structures, or conserved sequence motifs that occur at these locations. This pattern suggests the feature may be identifying elements important for non-coding RNA transcription or regulation. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, always manifesting as discrete spikes rather than continuous activation.",
