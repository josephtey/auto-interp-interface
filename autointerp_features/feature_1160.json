  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns in relation to genomic annotations across all examples, identifying consistently strong, sharp spike activations at specific locations. I noted the genomic elements present at each activation site and searched for common features.",
  "findings": "The feature shows a remarkably consistent pattern across all examples - a strong, sharp activation spike at the same relative location within different bacterial genomes. The spike appears consistently in proximity to diverse gene clusters (ribosomal proteins, flagellar proteins, metabolic enzymes, hypothetical proteins), suggesting it's detecting a sequence motif rather than a specific gene family. The activation is notably uniform in shape and intensity (~20-22 units) across all examples, indicating a highly specific sequence feature.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects a specific DNA sequence motif that appears consistently across diverse bacterial genomes in various functional contexts.",

  "description": "This feature detects a highly specific DNA sequence motif that appears consistently across diverse bacterial genomes. The feature activates with a sharp, strong spike pattern (~20-22 units) at specific genomic positions regardless of the surrounding genes or their functions. The motif appears in the context of diverse gene clusters including ribosomal operons, flagellar assembly genes, metabolic pathways, and uncharacterized proteins, suggesting it represents a universal sequence element rather than a functional gene category. The consistent intensity and positioning of the activation across taxonomically diverse bacteria (proteobacteria, firmicutes, spirochetes, euryarchaeotes) indicates this likely represents a fundamental bacterial sequence pattern with potential roles in genome structure or function. The motif may represent a binding site, structural element, or other conserved sequence feature.",
