  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across 10 genomic examples, focusing on the specific location of sharp activation spikes and their relationship to surrounding annotations. In all examples, a consistent sharp spike pattern is evident at specific locations within the genome segments. The spike appears to have no relationship to specific gene family, but instead occurs at regular positions within the genomic visualization window.",
  "findings": "The activation spike consistently appears at almost exactly the same position in each visualization - usually around the beginning of the displayed 10kb window (e.g., position 3,050,000 in example 1, position 850,000 in example 2, etc.). This pattern is independent of the specific genes or functional elements present in each genome. The feature produces a single, high-magnitude peak (activation ~20-25) in each case, with virtually no activation elsewhere in the window. This suggests the feature may be detecting a specific sequence motif or structural element that appears consistently at this visualization boundary position rather than a biologically significant genomic element.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely represents a technical artifact in the visualization or data processing pipeline rather than a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature detects a position-specific artifact that consistently appears at the beginning of each visualization window, regardless of the underlying genomic content or organism. The feature shows a sharp, intense spike (~20-25 activation units) that is identical in shape and position across diverse genomes from different bacterial and archaeal phyla. This artifact appears independent of gene content, genomic context, or biological function. The consistent positioning at visualization boundaries rather than at biologically significant elements suggests this is a technical artifact of the representation system rather than a meaningful genomic feature.",
