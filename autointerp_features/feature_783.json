  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example carefully, noting the precise location of activation peaks and their relationship to genomic annotations. I observed that in all examples, there's a consistent sharp activation spike that appears at a very specific genomic location. After examining the annotations near these activation peaks across multiple examples, I noticed these peaks consistently appear near or at the boundary between genes/coding sequences and non-coding regions, particularly where ribosomal RNA genes and their promoters might be located.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation spikes at locations that appear to be gene boundaries or regulatory regions. In example 8, we can clearly see the activation occurs near ribosomal RNA genes (5S and 23S rRNA). In other examples, the activation occurs at transitions between coding sequences, which could indicate regulatory elements or promoter regions. The pattern is remarkably consistent across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes, suggesting this feature is detecting a conserved genomic signal related to transcriptional regulation or RNA processing sites.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to promoter regions and/or transcription start sites, particularly near ribosomal RNA genes or between coding sequences.",

  "description": "This feature detects transcription start sites (TSS) or promoter regions, with particularly strong activation near ribosomal RNA genes and between coding sequences. The feature produces sharp, distinct activation spikes rather than broad regions of activation, suggesting it's identifying precise genomic positions where transcription begins. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse prokaryotic genomes, including both bacteria and archaea, indicating it's detecting a conserved genomic element fundamental to transcriptional regulation. In example 8, we see direct evidence of activation adjacent to ribosomal RNA genes, while other examples show activation at positions that likely correspond to promoters or regulatory elements between coding sequences. The conservation across diverse organisms suggests this feature captures a fundamental aspect of RNA polymerase binding sites or associated regulatory elements.",
