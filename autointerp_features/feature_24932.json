  "reasoning": "I carefully analyzed the feature activation patterns across all provided examples, noting that all images show consistent, high-amplitude activation across coding sequences in Rothia nasimurium, a high G+C Gram-positive bacterium. The feature activates strongly and continuously across entire genomic regions with only small gaps between genes. These gaps likely correspond to intergenic regions or regulatory elements where activation drops. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent across all examples, spanning diverse functional gene categories including metabolic pathways, transcription factors, DNA repair systems, and structural proteins.",
  "findings": "This feature appears to detect coding sequences in high G+C content bacterial genomes, specifically in Rothia nasimurium. The pattern is characterized by continuous high activation (10-15 units) across coding regions with sharp drops at likely intergenic boundaries. The feature activates regardless of gene function, suggesting it detects a fundamental property of coding sequences in this organism such as codon usage bias, GC content, or other sequence composition characteristics typical of high G+C Gram-positive bacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern that corresponds to coding sequences in high G+C content bacteria.",

  "description": "This feature robustly detects coding sequences in high G+C content bacterial genomes, particularly in Rothia nasimurium. The activation pattern shows strong, sustained signals (10-15 units) across genes regardless of their functional category, with sharp drops at likely intergenic regions. This suggests the feature is detecting fundamental properties common to bacterial coding sequences in high G+C organisms, such as codon usage patterns, GC-rich third codon positions, or other compositional biases characteristic of these genomes. The pattern is remarkably consistent across all examples, spanning diverse functional gene categories. This feature could be valuable for identifying coding regions in unannotated high G+C bacterial genomes or detecting horizontal gene transfer events between organisms with different GC contents.",
