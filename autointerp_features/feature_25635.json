  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example looking for patterns in where the feature shows strong activation in relation to genomic annotations. The activation pattern consistently appears as sharp, distinct spikes with high amplitude rather than broad regions. I examined the genomic context at each activation site, noting the nearby genes and their functions, looking for commonalities across different genomic regions from various organisms.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp, high-amplitude activations near tRNA genes or ribosomal RNA genes in bacterial genomes. In section_8, there's a strong activation directly over \"rrl: 23S ribosomal RNA\" (ID 2). In section_3, the activation occurs near \"trnI: tRNA-Ile(tat)\" (ID 10). In section_5, activation is near \"trnS: tRNA-Ser(tga)\" (ID 2). While not all examples explicitly show tRNA/rRNA annotations, the activation pattern and strength are remarkably consistent, suggesting the feature detects a specific sequence motif common to these RNA gene regions or their promoters.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects conserved sequence motifs associated with tRNA genes or rRNA promoter regions across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects highly conserved sequence motifs associated with bacterial tRNA genes and ribosomal RNA genes. The feature activates with sharp, high-amplitude spikes precisely at or near these non-coding RNA genes. The consistent pattern suggests detection of promoter elements or conserved structural features essential for transcription of these critical RNA molecules. The signal is remarkably consistent across diverse bacterial genomes, reflecting the evolutionary conservation of these essential RNA gene structures. This feature could be instrumental in identifying unannotated tRNA/rRNA genes or promoters in bacterial genomes.",
