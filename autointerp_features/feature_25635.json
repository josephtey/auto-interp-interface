  "reasoning": "I examined each activation pattern and its genomic context, noting that in all examples, there's a sharp activation spike occurring at or very near tRNA genes. I tracked the position of these spikes relative to the annotated tRNA genes and found consistent overlap in multiple genomes across different bacterial phyla.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, precise activation at transfer RNA (tRNA) genes in multiple bacterial genomes. Specifically, the tRNA types include tRNA-fMet, tRNA-Ser, tRNA-Leu, and tRNA-His. The activation appears as a sharp, high-amplitude spike directly over the tRNA gene position. This pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes/CFB group, and Mycoplasma.",
  "conclusion": "This feature definitively captures tRNA genes across diverse bacterial genomes with high precision and consistency.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes across bacterial genomes. The activation pattern appears as a sharp, high-amplitude spike precisely at the tRNA gene location. The feature is remarkably consistent, capturing various tRNA types (tRNA-fMet, tRNA-Ser, tRNA-Leu, tRNA-His) across phylogenetically diverse bacteria including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Mycoplasma. The biological significance relates to the essential role of tRNAs in protein synthesis. The model likely recognizes the distinctive secondary structure elements or sequence motifs common to tRNA genes, such as the conserved cloverleaf structure, despite differences in the specific anticodon sequences. This feature's consistency across bacterial phyla indicates it captures fundamental, evolutionarily conserved aspects of tRNA genes.",
