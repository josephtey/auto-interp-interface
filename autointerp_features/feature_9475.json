  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across multiple genomic regions, identifying the genomic elements present at activation peaks. I observed that strong activation spikes consistently appear at or near ion transport-related genes, particularly cation transporters and cytochrome oxidase components.",
  "findings": "The feature strongly activates near ion transport systems including: potassium transporters (kch, kdpA/B/C, trkA), metal transporters (zntA, mgtA, fieF), and cytochrome oxidase components (ccoN/O/P/Q). The most consistent pattern shows activation associated with cation-transporting P-type ATPases (zntA) and cytochrome c oxidase (cbb3-type) components, especially near the ccoN gene (subunit I) in multiple bacterial species.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects bacterial ion transport-related genes, particularly focusing on membrane-associated cation transport systems and respiratory chain components.",
  "title": "Cation transporters and cytochrome oxidase detector",

  "description": "This feature detects bacterial ion transport machinery, particularly: - Cation-transporting P-type ATPases (especially zntA gene) - Cytochrome c oxidase cbb3-type components (ccoN/O/P/Q operon) - Various potassium, magnesium and divalent metal transporters - The feature reliably activates at the gene boundaries of these transport elements - Strong activation is seen across diverse bacterial phyla including proteobacteria and firmicutes - The pattern represents membrane-bound transport systems that maintain ion homeostasis and facilitate respiration - The most consistent activation occurs at ccoN/zntA genes",
