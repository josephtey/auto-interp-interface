  "reasoning": "I observed that the feature consistently shows strong activation patterns in discrete, concentrated regions of the genome. Each activation profile has high-intensity spikes concentrated over specific areas, typically spanning approximately 1-2kb regions. These activation regions appear to occur near or within specific genetic elements rather than between genes.",
  "findings": "The activation patterns consistently occur over bacterial non-coding RNA elements, particularly in sections containing the bacterial RNase P RNA. This is clearly seen in sections 1 and 9, where the feature peaks directly over annotated RNase P RNA elements (STnc130 in Citrobacter and RNaseP_bact_b in Jeotgalibacillus). In examples without explicitly annotated ncRNA elements, the activation pattern still appears in regions that likely contain structured RNA elements. The feature shows stronger activation in proteobacteria and firmicutes than in archaea, suggesting some taxonomic specificity.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects bacterial non-coding RNA elements, particularly RNase P RNA and likely other structured ncRNAs.",

  "description": "This feature detects bacterial non-coding RNA elements, particularly RNase P RNA. The feature shows strong activation patterns spanning the entire length of these structured RNA elements, suggesting it recognizes specific sequence or structural characteristics of functional non-coding RNAs. The consistent activation pattern in diverse bacterial genomes (both proteobacteria and firmicutes) indicates this feature captures conserved properties of these essential RNA elements. RNase P RNA is functionally important for tRNA processing, serving as the catalytic component of the ribonucleoprotein complex that processes precursor tRNAs. The feature demonstrates taxonomic specificity with stronger signals in bacteria than archaea.",
