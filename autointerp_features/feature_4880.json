{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example carefully, looking for patterns in the feature activation relative to genome annotations. I noticed the feature consistently produces sharp, high-amplitude spikes at specific genomic positions, often near or at gene boundaries. I examined whether the feature corresponds to specific gene functions, promoter regions, or intergenic spaces.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong spike activations that don't correlate with any specific gene function across examples. Activations appear at various genomic locations including near ribosomal proteins, metabolic enzymes, and hypothetical proteins. There's no consistent pattern regarding the position of activation relative to genes (upstream, downstream, or within). The feature appears to respond to a sequence-specific motif rather than functional elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely detects a specific short DNA sequence motif that occurs across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes without functional correlation.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific short DNA sequence motif that appears across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes. The feature consistently produces sharp, high-amplitude activation spikes that don't correlate with any particular gene function or category. The motif occurs in various genomic contexts - near ribosomal proteins, metabolic enzymes, transporters, and hypothetical proteins across different taxonomic groups. The lack of consistent positioning relative to genes or functional categories suggests it detects a sequence-specific pattern rather than a functional element. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, appearing in diverse organisms including proteobacteria, archaea, and CFB group bacteria, indicating it may be a widely distributed DNA sequence feature.",
