  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example carefully to identify patterns in feature activation. The feature consistently shows strong, sharp spike activations that precisely coincide with transfer RNA (tRNA) annotations or directly adjacent to CRISPR elements. The activations appear as isolated, high-amplitude peaks rather than broad regions of activation.",
  "findings": "The feature demonstrates strong activation specifically on or near tRNA genes and CRISPR-associated elements. In section_4, the activation spike aligns perfectly with trnM (tRNA-Met). In section_3, the activation coincides with trnV (tRNA-Val). In section_1, activation occurs near trnH (tRNA-His). Sections 0, 6, and 8 show strong correlation with CRISPR elements (repeats or spacers). The activation pattern consistently appears as a sharp, singular spike rather than a broad region, suggesting recognition of a specific sequence motif common to these structural RNA elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to structural non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and CRISPR elements.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA genes and CRISPR RNA elements (repeats/spacers). The activation manifests as sharp, distinct spikes precisely at these non-coding RNA locations. The feature appears to recognize a common structural or sequence motif shared between tRNAs and CRISPR RNA elements, both of which form distinctive secondary structures. This likely represents the detection of specific RNA structural motifs that are evolutionarily conserved across bacterial genomes. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with every activation spike corresponding to either a tRNA gene or CRISPR element, suggesting this feature has specialized in recognizing these functionally important non-coding RNA elements critical for bacterial translation and adaptive immunity.",
