  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image carefully, noting that in every example there's a single sharp activation spike in the activation pattern. These spikes consistently appear at or very near CRISPR repeat annotations. In multiple examples (sections 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9), the activation spike aligns precisely with regions labeled as \"CRISPR repeat\" elements. The pattern is highly specific and shows consistent positioning. The activation is not associated with genes, tRNAs, or other genomic features present in the images.",
  "findings": "This feature shows strong and specific activation precisely at CRISPR repeat sequences across bacterial genomes. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems that consist of repeat-spacer arrays. The feature consistently detects the repeat elements, which are conserved DNA sequences between CRISPR spacers. CRISPR repeats typically have palindromic structure and specific sequence motifs that differentiate them from other genomic elements. This feature appears to identify this specific signature with high precision, regardless of the surrounding genomic context.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to CRISPR repeat elements, a critical component of bacterial adaptive immunity.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR repeat elements in bacterial genomes. It shows high-amplitude, localized activation precisely at annotated CRISPR repeat locations. CRISPR repeats are conserved sequences that separate spacer elements in CRISPR arrays, which function as part of bacterial adaptive immune systems against phage infection. The feature likely recognizes the characteristic palindromic structure or sequence motifs unique to these repeats. The pattern is remarkably consistent across examples, showing sharp activation spikes exclusively at CRISPR repeat locations, regardless of genomic context or neighboring genes. This suggests the feature is capturing fundamental sequence or structural characteristics of CRISPR repeats that are conserved across different bacterial species.",
