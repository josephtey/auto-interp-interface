  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in where the feature activates strongly. Each example shows a sharp spike of activation at specific genomic positions. I noted the annotations directly at these activation points and those in close proximity. I compared these across all examples to detect common patterns.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, this feature consistently activates at specific points within operons or gene clusters related to sporulation, especially in Firmicutes bacteria like Methylomusa anaerophila. The most consistent pattern shows activation near stage III sporulation proteins (spoIIIA genes) and other sporulation-related proteins. In examples without sporulation genes, activation appears at functionally related regulatory or stress response elements. The feature activations are distinct, precise spikes rather than broad regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects regulatory elements or motifs associated with bacterial sporulation pathways, particularly in Firmicutes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects regulatory elements or conserved sequence motifs associated with bacterial sporulation pathways, primarily in Firmicutes bacteria. The activation pattern shows precise, high-intensity spikes at specific positions near sporulation-related genes, particularly stage III sporulation proteins (spoIIIA genes). In examples where sporulation genes aren't present, the feature activates near stress response elements or regulatory proteins that may relate to survival mechanisms. The consistency of these sharp activation patterns suggests the feature is detecting a specific regulatory motif or sequence element rather than the coding sequences themselves. This pattern is most prevalent in Firmicutes (especially Methylomusa anaerophila), a phylum known for sporulation capabilities, indicating potential taxonomic specificity to this genomic element.",
