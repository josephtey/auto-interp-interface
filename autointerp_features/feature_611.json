  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example for distinct activation patterns and their genomic context. Each image shows a single sharp spike in feature activation occurring at specific genomic positions. I examined the proximity of these activation peaks to various genomic annotations, looking for consistent patterns across examples.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, the feature consistently shows strong activation peaks near CRISPR-related elements. In sections 2, 4, and 7, the activation spikes appear in proximity to CRISPR repeats and spacers. The feature also appears to activate near gene boundaries or intergenic regions in bacterial genomes, often between functionally diverse genes. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent - always appearing as a single, sharp spike rather than broad activation regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern related to CRISPR elements or specific sequence motifs at genomic boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif likely associated with CRISPR elements or gene boundaries in bacterial genomes. The activation consistently appears as a single sharp spike rather than extended activation, suggesting recognition of a specific short sequence or structural element. In sections 2, 4, and 7, the feature activates near annotated CRISPR repeats and spacers, while in other examples it appears at boundaries between genes with diverse functions. This pattern suggests the feature may recognize a conserved sequence element that serves as a genomic delimiter or recognition site, potentially involved in genome organization, mobile genetic elements, or CRISPR-associated functions. The consistency of the sharp spike pattern across diverse genomic contexts indicates a highly specific sequence recognition feature.",
