  "reasoning": "I examined the activation pattern in each example and its relationship to the annotations. The feature consistently shows sharp activation spikes near or overlapping with two-component system proteins - specifically histidine kinases and their associated response regulators. Across multiple examples, the activation coincides with genes like baeS (histidine kinase), ompR and cusR (response regulators), and cheY (response regulator receiver domain).",
  "findings": "This feature detects bacterial two-component signaling systems, which are ubiquitous mechanisms bacteria use to sense and respond to environmental changes. In each example, the activation spike occurs precisely at or near histidine kinases (like baeS in examples 4, 6) or response regulators (like ompR/cusR in examples 6, 7). The feature recognizes both components of these systems with high specificity. It activates across diverse bacterial phyla including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and others, suggesting this is a fundamental bacterial genomic pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically significant pattern related to bacterial signal transduction machinery, specifically two-component systems.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects bacterial two-component signaling system components, particularly histidine kinases and their cognate response regulators. The activation consistently appears as sharp spikes directly at these regulatory genes. These two-component systems are critical for bacterial environmental sensing and signal transduction, allowing bacteria to respond to changing conditions. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial phyla, showing strong activation for genes annotated as histidine kinases (baeS), response regulators (ompR, cusR, cheY), or related signaling components. The feature likely recognizes sequence motifs characteristic of the conserved domains in these signaling proteins, which are essential for bacterial adaptation and survival.",
