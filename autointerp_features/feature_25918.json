  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify activation patterns and their relationship to genomic annotations. I noted that strong activation consistently appears over specific genes, particularly chaperonin genes. By comparing across examples, I found a clear pattern of high activation specifically over groEL/groES genes across different bacterial species, primarily from Firmicutes.",
  "findings": "The feature activates strongly and specifically over groEL (chaperonin GroEL) genes and often extends to the adjacent groES (co-chaperone GroES) genes. This pattern is highly consistent across multiple examples from different organisms. In several cases (examples 1, 3, 7, 8), we see the exact same genomic arrangement with groL/groEL followed by groES, with strong feature activation across both genes. The activation pattern typically extends across the entire coding sequence of these genes with high intensity (activation values of 3-4).",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly identifies chaperonin GroEL and co-chaperone GroES genes across various bacterial genomes, representing a biologically significant heat shock protein detection signature.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects the GroEL/GroES chaperonin system, primarily activating across the groL/groEL gene with extension to the adjacent groES gene in most cases. The activation typically spans the entire coding sequence of these genes with strong intensity. GroEL/GroES form a molecular chaperone complex essential for protein folding, particularly during heat stress. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple examples, predominantly in Firmicutes (Lactobacillus, Companilactobacillus, Jeotgalibaca, etc.) and also appears in Mycoplasmas. This represents a fundamental and conserved bacterial stress response system.",
