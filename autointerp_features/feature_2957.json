  "reasoning": "I tracked feature activation patterns across all examples, noting they consistently appear in Mycoplasma genomes (primarily M. phocoeninasale) as distinct high-intensity clusters. I examined the relationship between these activation peaks and the annotated genomic elements, looking for patterns in positioning and gene types.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation in regions containing tRNA genes and nearby elements. In section_4, activation peaks near trnR (ID 11); in section_5, strong activation appears near DUF3800-I RNA (ID 7); in section_6, activation occurs around trnL and trnS genes (IDs 2 and 12); in section_8, activation coincides with trnS gene (ID 6). This pattern suggests the feature detects tRNA genes or associated secondary structures. The strong, localized activation patterns appear consistently in mycoplasma genomes, particularly near functional RNA elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes and potentially their associated promoter or terminator structures in Mycoplasma genomes.",

  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and potentially their surrounding regulatory elements in Mycoplasma genomes. The activation pattern typically shows strong, localized spikes directly at or immediately adjacent to tRNA annotations. The feature likely recognizes the conserved structural elements of tRNA genes, such as their characteristic cloverleaf secondary structure or promoter/terminator sequences. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple examples from Mycoplasma phocoeninasale, suggesting specificity for tRNA detection in this bacterial genus. This corresponds to the biological importance of tRNAs in translation, with the feature potentially helping identify these critical non-coding RNA elements within the genome.",
