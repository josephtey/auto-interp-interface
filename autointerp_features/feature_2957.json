  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image carefully to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I focused on the high-activation regions and their consistent relationship with specific genomic elements across multiple examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation peaks directly over or adjacent to tRNA genes and CRISPR repeats/spacers. In several examples (sections 0, 3, 7, 8, 9), the strongest activation occurs precisely at tRNA locations or CRISPR elements. The pattern appears across different tRNA types (tRNA-Arg, tRNA-Thr, tRNA-Glu, tRNA-Lys) and in diverse genomic contexts. When not directly over these elements, activations occur in regions that contain repetitive or structured non-coding RNA.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes and CRISPR repeat elements, suggesting it captures conserved structural or sequence characteristics common to these non-coding RNA elements.",
  "title": "tRNA and CRISPR RNA structure detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects structured non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and CRISPR repeats/spacers. The feature activates strongly directly over these elements, showing sharp, high-amplitude spikes. The consistent detection across different tRNA types suggests the feature recognizes conserved structural characteristics rather than specific sequences. tRNAs and CRISPR RNAs share important secondary structure properties (stem-loops, hairpins) despite different functions - tRNAs in translation and CRISPR RNAs in bacterial immunity. The pattern appears highly consistent across examples, with very similar activation shapes regardless of genomic context, indicating a biologically meaningful detection of these structured RNA elements with crucial roles in cellular processes.",
