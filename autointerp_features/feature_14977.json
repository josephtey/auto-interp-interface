  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all examples to identify commonalities. The most consistent observation is that strong activation peaks consistently appear over CRISPR arrays in multiple examples, particularly over the repeat-spacer junctions and repeats themselves. This pattern is evident in examples from Desulforamulus ferrireducens, Thermococcus cleftensis, and Kroppenstedtia eburnea.",
  "findings": "The feature shows highest activation specifically over CRISPR arrays containing repeats of approximately 30-31bp in length, with consistent consensus sequences ending in \"GAAAC\" (e.g., GTTGCAATAAGACTCTGGGAGAATTGAAAC, GTTTCAATTCCTTATAGGTACGTTCTAAAC). The signal appears strongest at repeat regions rather than spacers, with particularly high activation at the repeat-spacer boundaries. This pattern appears across diverse bacterial and archaeal phyla, suggesting a sequence-specific detection that transcends phylogeny.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects a specific sequence motif within CRISPR repeat elements, particularly those ending with \"GAAAC.\"",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR repeat sequences, particularly those ending with the conserved \"GAAAC\" motif. The feature shows strong activation across the entire CRISPR array regions, with highest intensity directly over repeat sequences rather than spacers. The activation pattern remains consistent across diverse prokaryotic phyla including Firmicutes, Euryarchaeota, and Proteobacteria, suggesting it detects a highly conserved sequence element rather than taxonomic-specific patterns. CRISPR systems function as adaptive immune mechanisms in prokaryotes, with repeats serving as structural elements for the proper processing of CRISPR transcripts. The feature likely captures a structurally or functionally important sequence motif within these repeats that is maintained across diverse prokaryotic CRISPR systems.",
