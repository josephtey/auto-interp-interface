  "reasoning": "I analyzed the feature activation patterns across 10 genomic sequences, identifying where activations occur relative to annotated genes. I focused on consistent patterns across examples, noting the specific gene contexts in which high activations occur.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently activates within or near CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes and CRISPR systems. In section_0, activation occurs precisely at cas3u/cas7u genes. In section_5/6/1/9/3, activations occur in Haliangium ochraceum, a bacterium with multiple CRISPR-associated regions. In section_4, activations appear near mobile genetic elements (transposases), which often co-occur with CRISPR systems. The feature shows higher activation in areas containing genes for defense systems, particularly those involved in CRISPR-Cas immunity.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with CRISPR-Cas systems and bacterial defense mechanisms.",
  "title": "CRISPR-Cas system detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects sequences associated with CRISPR-Cas systems, specifically regions containing Cas genes and associated defense elements. The feature activates directly within or immediately adjacent to Cas genes (cas3u, cas7u, cas8g) and CRISPR-associated regions. It appears to recognize sequence characteristics unique to these prokaryotic adaptive immune systems. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with strong spikes of activation precisely at CRISPR-Cas loci. The feature is particularly active in Haliangium ochraceum, appearing in 5 of the 10 examples, suggesting possible specificity for CRISPR systems in this organism or closely related bacteria. This detection capability could represent recognition of important genomic defense regions that protect bacteria against foreign genetic elements.",
