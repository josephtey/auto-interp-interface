{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I noticed strong activation peaks consistently occurring in regions containing phospholipase genes or related enzymes. The patterns show specific, intense activation peaks at or near phospholipase genes in multiple bacterial genomes, with varying taxonomic backgrounds.",
  "findings": "The feature shows specific, high-intensity activation at phospholipase genes and related enzymes across diverse bacterial genomes. In example 1, activation coincides with a zinc-dependent phospholipase C. In example 5, peak activation occurs at a zinc-dependent phospholipase C family protein. Example 2 shows activation at a phospholipase near position 2.51\u00d710^6. Examples 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 show similar patterns of activation near genes encoding hydrolases, phospholipases, or related enzymes. The feature appears to detect a sequence motif specific to bacterial phospholipases, particularly zinc-dependent phospholipase C enzymes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects bacterial phospholipase C genes across diverse bacterial genomes, representing a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects bacterial phospholipase C genes and related hydrolases across diverse bacterial genomes. The activation pattern shows distinct spikes directly over annotated phospholipase C genes or zinc-dependent phospholipase genes. The pattern is highly consistent, appearing in multiple bacterial species from different taxonomic groups including Firmicutes, Spirochetes, and CFB group bacteria. This likely represents detection of a conserved sequence motif within phospholipase C genes, which are important virulence factors in many bacteria, involved in degrading host cell membranes during infection. The pattern is extremely consistent, with 8 of 10 examples showing clear activation directly at phospholipase genes.",
