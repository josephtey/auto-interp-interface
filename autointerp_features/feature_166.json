  "reasoning": "I carefully examined all 10 examples, noting the precise genomic locations where feature activation occurs and their relationship to annotated features. In each case, I identified where the activation peaks appeared strongest and analyzed their proximity to specific genomic elements. I then looked for patterns across examples to determine what consistent genomic features might be associated with activation.",
  "findings": "Across examples, the feature consistently shows strong activation peaks that coincide with tRNA gene locations. In section_0.png, activation occurs directly over trnP (tRNA-Pro); in section_4.png, activation aligns with trnL (tRNA-Leu); in sections_1.png, section_2.png, and others with CRISPR spacers, the activation peaks appear at these structured RNA elements. The activation is highly specific, showing sharp, defined peaks with activation values between 3-4 units, and occurs regardless of surrounding protein-coding genes. This suggests the feature detects specific structural or sequence characteristics common to non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and CRISPR-associated sequences.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to structured non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and CRISPR spacers.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and CRISPR-associated sequences. The activation pattern shows sharp, defined peaks directly over these RNA elements, suggesting recognition of their unique structural or sequence characteristics. The feature appears sensitive to the unique sequence or structural motifs common in tRNAs (seen in tRNA-Pro, tRNA-Leu examples) and CRISPR spacers. This pattern likely represents detection of stable RNA secondary structures or specific sequence patterns characteristic of functional non-coding RNAs. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial species, indicating it identifies a fundamental and conserved feature of structured RNA elements rather than taxon-specific patterns.",
