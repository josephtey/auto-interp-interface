  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, focusing on their relationship to genomic annotations. I observed single, sharp activation spikes that consistently appear at specific positions, usually at intergenic regions or near gene boundaries. The context around these activations varies, but the spike pattern remains consistent.",
  "findings": "The feature demonstrates sharp, localized activation spikes without regard to specific gene function or organism type. Activations occur in diverse organisms including proteobacteria, firmicutes, and archaea, often between coding sequences. In multiple examples from Ferroplasma species, the feature activates in regions surrounded by hypothetical proteins. No consistent functional relationship exists between activated regions and neighboring genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely detects a specific DNA sequence motif or structural element rather than a functional gene category.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific DNA sequence motif or structural element that appears as sharp, isolated spikes in diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes. The feature is position-agnostic, showing no consistent relationship to specific gene functions, instead appearing at various genomic locations including intergenic regions and near gene boundaries. The spike pattern is remarkably consistent across examples despite diverse genomic contexts, suggesting detection of a conserved nucleotide pattern rather than a functional genomic element. The feature is taxonomically broad, activating in both bacteria (Acetivibrio, Pelobacter, Chryseobacterium) and archaea (Ferroplasma), indicating a widely distributed sequence motif potentially involved in DNA structure or genome organization rather than specific gene function.",
