  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image for patterns in feature activation, observing sharp spike-like activations consistently appearing at specific genomic positions. I examined the relationship between these activation spikes and nearby gene annotations, looking for recurring patterns across all examples. I paid particular attention to the genomic context around each activation, including neighboring genes and their functions.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows very sharp, high-amplitude activation spikes (reaching maximum value of 1.0) at precise genomic locations. These spikes appear as single points rather than broader regions of activation. No clear pattern emerges regarding specific gene associations - the activations occur near diverse types of genes including regulatory proteins, metabolic enzymes, structural proteins, and hypothetical proteins. There is no consistent positioning relative to gene bodies or intergenic regions. The feature appears to be detecting a very specific sequence motif or structural element that occurs independently of gene function or genome position.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely detects a specific DNA sequence motif or structural element that occurs across diverse bacterial genomes regardless of functional context.",

  "description": "This feature detects a highly specific DNA sequence motif or structural element that manifests as sharp, single-point activation spikes. The motif appears to be sequence-specific rather than function-specific, as it occurs in diverse genomic contexts without clear association to particular gene types or functional elements. The activation is remarkably consistent in its pattern - always appearing as an isolated, maximum-amplitude spike rather than a broader region of activation. The motif likely represents a short, highly conserved sequence that has been maintained across bacterial genomes, possibly due to structural importance rather than direct functional role. This pattern suggests the feature has learned to recognize a fundamental DNA sequence element that transcends functional annotation boundaries. The consistency of the activation pattern across all examples indicates this is a robust feature that detects a genuine biological signal rather than noise.",
