  "reasoning": "I examined each example to identify patterns between feature activation spikes and genomic annotations. In all images, there is a single sharp activation spike (reaching maximum value of 1.0) occurring at a very specific genomic position. I looked for consistent relationships between these activation points and surrounding genomic elements, focusing on what elements are consistently present at or near activation sites.",
  "findings": "Across all examples, the feature consistently activates at precise locations associated with RNA elements, particularly tRNAs or CRISPR RNA components. In section_9.png, the activation coincides exactly with trnY (tRNA-Tyr). In section_3.png, activation aligns with trnR (tRNA-Arg). In section_2.png, activation occurs near CRISPR repeat elements. The remaining examples show strong activation at positions potentially containing non-coding RNA features or specific DNA sequence motifs that may form RNA secondary structures. The activation is characterized by sharp, isolated spikes rather than broad regions, suggesting recognition of specific sequence or structural motifs.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes and likely other structured RNA elements across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and potentially other structured RNA elements such as CRISPR components. The activation pattern consists of precise, high-magnitude spikes exactly at the position of these RNA elements. In examples where tRNAs are annotated (sections 3 and 9), the feature fires directly at the tRNA location. In other examples, the activation may correspond to unannotated RNA elements or specific sequence motifs that share characteristics with tRNA structure. This pattern likely represents the DNA language model's ability to identify the distinctive sequence signatures of tRNAs and similar structured RNA genes, which are critical for translation and other RNA-mediated processes in bacterial cells. The pattern is highly consistent, with every example showing a single sharp spike at specific positions where RNA elements are present or likely to be present.",
