  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns in each image, noting their sharp, spike-like nature and consistent positioning. I observed that in multiple examples from Xanthomonas hyacinthi (sections 0, 1, 4, 5), the feature activates precisely at the annotated ALIL pseudoknot ncRNA-region. The activation occurs with the same pattern across different genomic contexts, suggesting specificity to this non-coding RNA element rather than surrounding genes.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, precise activation at ALIL pseudoknot regions in Xanthomonas hyacinthi. This non-coding RNA structure appears to be detected with high specificity, as evidenced by the sharp activation spike directly at the annotated ncRNA position. In all observed cases of ALIL pseudoknot presence, the feature shows maximal activation. The ALIL pseudoknot is likely a structured RNA element that may function in regulation or other RNA-mediated processes in these bacterial genomes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature definitively captures a biologically significant non-coding RNA element, specifically the ALIL pseudoknot structure found in Xanthomonas and related gamma-proteobacteria.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects the ALIL pseudoknot non-coding RNA structure in bacterial genomes. The activation pattern shows a sharp, precise spike directly at the ncRNA annotation, indicating high specificity for this structured RNA element. The feature shows consistent activation across multiple genomic contexts, always correlating with the ALIL pseudoknot annotation. This suggests the feature is detecting sequence and/or structural characteristics unique to this ncRNA. The ALIL pseudoknot appears primarily in Xanthomonas hyacinthi and potentially other gamma-proteobacteria, suggesting this RNA structure may have regulatory functions specific to these bacterial taxa.",
