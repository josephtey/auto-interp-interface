  "reasoning": "I observed consistent high activation patterns across all examples, with occasional drops in activation at specific points. The feature shows strong, continuous activation throughout coding regions spanning diverse bacterial genomes, particularly in \u03b3-proteobacteria like Ahniella affigens. Examining specific genes at activation sites reveals many proteins with structural repeat motifs (tetratricopeptide, ankyrin, pentapeptide, RHS repeats) and multi-domain proteins, especially those with bacterial secretion system components.",
  "findings": "This feature strongly activates across coding regions containing proteins with repetitive structural domains, particularly tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins (sections 4, 8), ankyrin repeat proteins (section 1), RHS repeat proteins (section 6), pentapeptide repeat proteins (section 9), and proteins with beta-propeller repeats (section 5). The feature also shows affinity for multi-domain proteins associated with bacterial secretion systems (sections 3, 7) and large structural/enzymatic proteins. The pattern appears primarily in bacterial genomes, particularly \u03b3-proteobacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with repetitive protein structural domains and complex multi-domain proteins.",

  "description": "This feature detects coding regions for proteins with repetitive structural motifs and multi-domain architectures in bacterial genomes. It specifically activates on genes encoding tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins, ankyrin repeat proteins, RHS repeat proteins, pentapeptide repeat proteins, and other structurally repetitive domains. The feature also shows affinity for complex multi-domain proteins involved in bacterial secretion systems (Type VI, flagellar) and large enzymatic proteins. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with strong continuous activation throughout these coding regions. The feature appears most active in \u03b3-proteobacteria, particularly Ahniella affigens, suggesting possible taxonomic specificity beyond just the presence of repeat domains.",
