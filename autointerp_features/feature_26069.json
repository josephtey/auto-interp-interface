  "reasoning": "I analyzed each genomic region where this feature shows strong activation, examining the precise timing and positioning of activation relative to gene annotations. I looked for recurring patterns across all examples to identify the genomic elements consistently associated with feature activation.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation patterns over large metabolic genes and operons in enterobacteria (primarily Cronobacter and Erwinia). Major activation is observed over genes like gltB (glutamate synthase), ppsA (phosphoenolpyruvate synthase), pntA (transhydrogenase), alaA (alanine transaminase), lrhA (transcriptional regulator), and various components of metabolic operons. The feature activation typically spans the entire coding region of these large genes rather than just promoters or specific motifs.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures large metabolic genes in enterobacteria, particularly those involved in central metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis.",
  "title": "Large Metabolic Gene Detector in Enterobacteria",
  "activation-pattern": "continuous",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects large metabolic genes in enterobacteria, particularly those involved in central carbon metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and energy production. The activation consistently spans the entire length of these genes rather than specific regulatory elements or motifs. The strongest activations occur over genes like gltB (glutamate synthase), ppsA (phosphoenolpyruvate synthase), pntA (transhydrogenase), lrhA (transcriptional regulator), and genes in the leucine and other amino acid biosynthesis pathways. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from Cronobacter and Erwinia species, suggesting this feature has specialized in detecting conserved metabolic machinery in this bacterial family. This likely represents the detection of sequence characteristics common to large, functionally important metabolic genes in enterobacteria.",
