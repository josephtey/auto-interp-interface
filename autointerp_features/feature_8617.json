{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example by examining the activation peaks in relation to genomic annotations, focusing on consistently appearing elements across examples. I identified a clear pattern where the feature strongly activates specifically at or near the rpmB gene (50S ribosomal protein L28) coding sequence across multiple bacterial and archaeal genomes.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong activation specifically at the rpmB gene location in 5 of the provided examples (sections 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9), with consistent spike patterns. The activation occurs directly at the gene body of rpmB, which encodes the 50S ribosomal protein L28, an essential component of the large ribosomal subunit in prokaryotes. This protein is involved in ribosome assembly and protein synthesis. The examples span diverse prokaryotic taxa including firmicutes, mycoplasmas, and possibly archaeal species, suggesting a conserved sequence pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a highly specific and biologically meaningful signal corresponding to the rpmB gene encoding the 50S ribosomal protein L28.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects the rpmB gene encoding the 50S ribosomal protein L28, an essential component of the large ribosomal subunit. The activation pattern shows sharp, intense spikes precisely at the rpmB gene location. The feature detects this gene regardless of flanking genomic context, suggesting it recognizes conserved sequence elements within the rpmB coding sequence itself. The pattern appears highly consistent across diverse prokaryotic phyla, including firmicutes, mycoplasmas and potentially archaeal species, indicating it detects evolutionarily conserved sequences critical for this core ribosomal component's function in protein synthesis.",
