  "reasoning": "I analyzed 10 activation patterns across various genomes to identify a consistent genomic feature. The activation shows sharp, distinct peaks consistently associated with specific RNA elements. In each example, the activation occurs directly at or overlapping with non-coding RNA features - particularly ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. The activation is not related to protein-coding genes that surround these elements.",
  "findings": "This feature strongly activates at non-coding RNA loci across different bacterial and archaeal species. Specifically, it recognizes structural RNA elements including 23S rRNA (section_6), 16S rRNA (section_9), CRISPR spacers (sections 0 and 1), T-box leader RNA (section_4), tRNA genes (section_1), and tmRNA (section_3). The activation pattern shows consistent sharp, high-magnitude peaks directly over these RNA elements regardless of genomic context or surrounding genes. The feature appears agnostic to the specific organism, activating on RNA elements in both bacteria (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria) and archaea (Euryarchaeotes, Crenarchaeotes).",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects structured non-coding RNA elements across diverse microbial genomes, representing a biologically significant pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects structured non-coding RNA elements including rRNAs, tRNAs, CRISPR spacers, and regulatory RNAs. The activation pattern shows sharp, high-magnitude spikes directly over the RNA element positions, with minimal activation elsewhere. The feature appears to recognize common structural characteristics of functional RNAs rather than specific sequences, as it activates on diverse RNA types across evolutionarily distant organisms (spanning both bacterial and archaeal domains). The consistency across examples suggests this feature captures fundamental properties of structured non-coding RNAs, which are critical for various cellular processes including protein synthesis, gene regulation, and defense against mobile genetic elements. The feature shows no taxonomic specificity, functioning universally across prokaryotic life.",
