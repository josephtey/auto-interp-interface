  "reasoning": "I examined each example to identify patterns in feature activation locations. Each image shows strong, sharp spike activations at specific positions. I noted the genes/elements at or near these spikes, looking for common functional or structural elements across different genomes. I observed that in many cases, activation spikes coincide with or are very close to tRNA genes. In examples without obvious tRNA annotations, the position is often near the end/start of genes that may have regulatory elements.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at or near tRNA genes in multiple examples: section_0 shows activation near trnW (tRNA-Trp), section_4 shows activation precisely at trnS (tRNA-Ser), and section_8 shows activation at trnT (tRNA-Thr). Where tRNAs aren't explicitly annotated, the feature often activates at intergenic regions that may contain small RNA elements or promoters. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent - sharp, discrete spikes rather than broad regions, suggesting recognition of a specific sequence motif rather than a general genomic feature. The feature appears across diverse bacteria and archaea, including Spiroplasma, Metamycoplasma, Pyrobaculum, Vibrio, and others.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with tRNA genes or similar structured RNA elements.",

  "description": "This feature detects tRNA genes or similar structured RNA elements across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes. It shows precise, sharp activation spikes directly at or immediately adjacent to tRNA gene positions. The consistency of the spike pattern suggests the feature recognizes a specific sequence or structural motif common to tRNA genes, such as the conserved promoter elements, the tRNA cloverleaf structure determinants, or termination signals. This pattern is highly consistent across examples from phylogenetically diverse organisms (Spiroplasma, Metamycoplasma, Pyrobaculum), indicating the feature captures an evolutionarily conserved element of tRNA genes. In examples where tRNAs aren't explicitly annotated, the feature may be detecting unannotated tRNAs or similar structured RNA elements.",
