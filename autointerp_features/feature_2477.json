  "reasoning": "I examined the activation pattern and genomic annotations in each example, focusing on the relationship between strong activation peaks and specific genomic elements. I looked for consistent patterns across examples to identify what genomic feature the neural network feature recognizes.",
  "findings": "In every example, the feature activates strongly in regions containing or adjacent to transcriptional regulators from the LacI/PurR family. Examples 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 clearly show strong activation specifically at purR genes (LacI family transcriptional regulators). The activation is typically a sharp, distinct peak at the location of these regulators. In all cases, the regulators are found in proximity to genes involved in sugar transport, metabolism, or related processes, which is consistent with the known role of LacI/PurR family transcription factors in regulating carbohydrate metabolism.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects LacI/PurR family transcriptional regulators across diverse bacterial species.",
  "title": "LacI/PurR family transcriptional regulator",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects LacI/PurR family transcriptional regulators across bacterial genomes. The feature shows a strong, sharp activation spike directly at the location of these regulatory genes. LacI/PurR family proteins are DNA-binding transcriptional regulators that typically control genes involved in sugar metabolism and transport. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa including Proteobacteria, Thermotogae, and other bacterial groups, suggesting the feature captures a conserved sequence signature specific to this transcription factor family. The surrounding genomic context often includes sugar transporters, metabolic enzymes, and other genes involved in carbohydrate utilization, consistent with the regulatory role of these proteins.",
