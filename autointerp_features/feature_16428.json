  "reasoning": "I analyzed 10 genomic images, each showing a sharp activation spike at a specific genomic position. In each case, the activation peak is a distinct vertical line with high magnitude. I examined the position of these spikes relative to surrounding genomic annotations, looking for consistent patterns across examples.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, I observed that the feature consistently activates at or near CRISPR elements and their associated proteins. In the Ferrimonas lipolytica example (section_6), the activation occurs directly at a CRISPR array with the spike positioned at CRISPR repeat/spacer elements, adjacent to cas6f (CRISPR-associated endoribonuclease). The Jeotgalibacillus example (section_1) shows activation near a TPP riboswitch (THI element), a structured RNA element. The other examples show activations at positions that likely contain structured RNA elements or repetitive sequences, though not explicitly annotated as such in all cases.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects CRISPR-associated elements and other structured RNA regions in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays and possibly other structured RNA elements like riboswitches. It activates with a sharp, high-magnitude spike precisely at these elements, particularly evident in the Ferrimonas example where the spike occurs directly at a CRISPR array containing three repeats. The feature may be detecting the characteristic sequence patterns or secondary structures formed by these repetitive elements, which are critical for RNA-guided adaptive immunity in prokaryotes. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, appearing in diverse bacterial phyla including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Archaea, suggesting this is a broadly conserved structural or sequence motif.",
