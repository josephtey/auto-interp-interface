  "reasoning": "I tracked the activation peaks across all examples, noting their positions relative to gene annotations. Each activation consistently appears as a sharp spike with maximum intensity (reaching 1.0) at precise locations within or at gene boundaries. I examined the genes/proteins associated with these activation points and looked for common functional categories, motifs, or genomic contexts.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at specific positions within bacterial genomes across diverse taxonomic groups (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, CFB group). The most striking pattern is that activation spikes occur primarily at gene boundaries or between closely positioned genes, particularly near transport-related proteins and secretion systems. Examples include activation near T9SS sorting domain proteins, ABC transporters, TolC family outer membrane proteins, membrane fusion proteins, and various efflux/permease components. The activation appears to mark intergenic regions or boundaries between genes involved in transport/secretion processes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects gene boundary regions near bacterial transport and secretion systems, suggesting a biological signal related to these genomic transitions.",

  "description": "This feature detects gene boundaries or intergenic regions specifically associated with bacterial transport and secretion systems. The activation consistently appears as sharp, high-intensity spikes (1.0) at precise locations where genes encoding transport-related proteins interface with neighboring genes. Examples include boundaries near ABC transporters, T9SS components, TolC family proteins, membrane fusion proteins, and various permeases/transporters. This pattern is observed across diverse bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and CFB group bacteria, suggesting the feature captures a conserved genomic signal related to transport system organization. The consistency of activation suggests this represents a biologically meaningful pattern important for genomic organization of transport systems, possibly indicating regulatory regions or specialized sequence patterns that facilitate proper expression and assembly of these multi-component systems.",
