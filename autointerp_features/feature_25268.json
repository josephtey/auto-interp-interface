  "reasoning": "I analyzed multiple genomic regions where this feature shows strong activation peaks, examining the patterns in relation to annotated genes. I looked for consistent relationships between activation sites and specific genomic elements across all examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp, distinct activation spikes at or near non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and rRNAs. In section_2, there's a strong peak near tRNA-Lys and 16S rRNA. Section_7 shows activation near a tRNA. In section_3, spikes appear near CRISPR repeats. The feature appears to detect DNA structural or sequence signatures associated with non-coding RNA genes or regulatory elements near gene boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to non-coding RNA elements and specific regulatory regions.",

  "description": "This feature detects genomic regions containing or proximal to non-coding RNA elements (tRNAs, rRNAs) and certain regulatory sequences like CRISPR repeats. The activation pattern consists of sharp, distinct spikes rather than broad regions of activation. The feature may be recognizing specific DNA structural characteristics or sequence motifs that are signatures of transcription boundaries or RNA processing sites. This likely represents regulatory or structural genomic elements important for RNA gene expression and processing. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with strong spikes occurring specifically at these specialized non-coding and regulatory regions rather than protein-coding genes.",
