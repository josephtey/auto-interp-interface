{
  "reasoning": "I examined activation patterns across all examples, noting that each shows sharp spike-like activations at specific genomic positions. I compared these activation positions with gene annotations to identify consistent patterns. The feature appears to have strong activations at boundary regions between genes, particularly at gene transition points.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp spike activations at or near gene boundaries. Looking across examples, these activations often occur at transitions between specific gene types. The feature doesn't appear to target specific gene families but rather detects transitional regions in the genome. This pattern is observed across various bacterial species.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures genomic transition zones between gene boundaries, which may represent regulatory regions or structural transition points in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects transition points between genes in bacterial genomes, typically showing sharp spike activations at gene boundaries. The feature activates consistently at positions where one gene ends and another begins, suggesting sensitivity to intergenic regions or promoter-like sequences. These regions often contain regulatory elements or structural transitions in the DNA. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial species including proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and CFB group bacteria. The precise biological function may relate to transcriptional regulation or genome organization, as these boundary regions often contain regulatory elements for gene expression control.",
