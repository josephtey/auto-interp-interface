  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify where the feature shows high activation and what genomic elements are present at those locations. I looked for patterns in the activation profile (sharp spikes) and examined the nearby annotations to determine what genomic elements consistently appear near activation sites.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp, strong activation spikes at or near tRNA genes. In example 6, the activation occurs precisely at trnV (tRNA-Val). In example 0, activation appears near rrs (16S ribosomal RNA). In example 3, the activation spike aligns with trnS (tRNA-Ser). The activation pattern is remarkably specific, showing very little activation elsewhere in the genome, suggesting this feature detects non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes and possibly other non-coding RNA elements across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes in bacterial genomes, showing sharp, high-magnitude activation spikes precisely at tRNA loci. The activation is highly specific and localized, with virtually no signal elsewhere in the genomic regions. While not all examples show a tRNA annotation, those that do (sections 6, 0, and 3) show perfect alignment between the activation spike and the tRNA annotation. tRNAs are critical non-coding RNA molecules that transport amino acids to ribosomes during translation. The feature's ability to detect these elements suggests it has learned the characteristic structural patterns of tRNA genes, including their promoter elements and conserved secondary structure. This pattern is consistent across different bacterial genomes, indicating the feature has captured fundamental sequence characteristics of tRNA genes rather than species-specific patterns.",
