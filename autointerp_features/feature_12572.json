  "reasoning": "I examined each example carefully, looking for patterns in where the feature activates in relation to genomic annotations. In all examples, the feature shows a sharp, narrow spike (activation) pattern at very specific locations. When correlating these activations with the genomic annotations, I observed they consistently occur near or between genes, often in intergenic regions or at gene boundaries. There doesn't appear to be a consistent relationship with specific gene types across all examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at precise genomic positions that appear to be intergenic regions or boundaries between genes. There is no strong correlation with specific gene functions across examples. In several cases (sections 0, 3, 4, 7, 8), the feature activates in Arsenophonus and other bacterial genomes. The activation pattern resembles what might be expected for a structural genomic element or potential regulatory site rather than protein-coding regions themselves. The narrow, high-intensity spikes suggest a very specific sequence motif is being detected.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely captures a specific DNA sequence motif or structural element that appears at intergenic regions across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific DNA sequence motif or structural element that occurs primarily in intergenic regions or at gene boundaries. The feature shows consistent, sharp activation spikes of high intensity at these locations, suggesting recognition of a precise sequence pattern. The motif appears across diverse bacterial genomes, particularly in Arsenophonus endosymbionts, but also in other bacteria and archaea. This may represent a conserved regulatory element, binding site, or structural feature important for genome organization or gene regulation. The consistency of the sharp, isolated activation pattern across diverse examples suggests this is capturing a genuine biological signal rather than random noise.",
