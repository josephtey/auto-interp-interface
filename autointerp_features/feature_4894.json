  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify where the feature activates strongly (sharp peaks) and analyzed the corresponding genomic annotations at those locations. I looked for patterns in gene functions, spatial relationships, and taxonomic distribution across the examples to determine what common element might trigger this feature.",
  "findings": "In all images, the feature shows consistent, sharp activation spikes rather than broad patterns. These spikes occur at specific boundaries, particularly at gene junctions or intergenic regions. Notably, the spikes often appear near tRNA genes (in one example), between coding sequences with diverse functions, and often near regulatory elements. The feature activates across diverse bacterial and archaeal species, suggesting it's capturing a fundamental genomic element rather than a taxon-specific pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects a structural or sequence motif at specific genomic boundaries that transcends individual gene functions.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence or structural motif at intergenic boundaries across diverse prokaryotic genomes. The sharp, consistent activation spikes occur at precise locations between genes, often near regulatory elements or at transitions between functional units. The feature appears agnostic to the specific genes involved, activating across bacteria and archaea with similar patterns. This suggests it recognizes a fundamental genomic structural element like a transcription terminator, attenuator, or specific intergenic sequence motif that serves as a genetic delimiter. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with activation intensity suggesting strong sequence conservation at these boundary regions, potentially indicating functional importance in gene expression regulation or genome organization.",
