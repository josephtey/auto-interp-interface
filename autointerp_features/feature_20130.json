  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across multiple genomic regions, noting their strength, shape, and positioning relative to annotated genes. I identified the genomic elements consistently present at or near activation peaks, and analyzed their functional relationships. I looked for patterns in gene function, orientation, and biological pathways among the genes associated with strong activations.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation peaks associated with tRNA genes or in regions adjacent to tRNA genes. In section_2, the activation occurs near trnS (tRNA-Ser); in section_4, strong activation appears between trnS and trnE; in section_6, activation occurs near 6S RNA (another non-coding RNA). The feature appears to detect sequence motifs characteristic of tRNA genes or their promoter regions. The activation pattern is highly specific and consistent, showing sharp peaks with strong signal intensity (often reaching 6-7 units). The feature activates regardless of the specific tRNA type (Ser, Glu) suggesting it detects a common structural element across tRNA genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with tRNA genes and their regulatory elements.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and their promoter regions in bacterial genomes. The activation consistently shows strong, localized spikes that coincide with or are adjacent to annotated tRNA genes (trnS, trnE) or other non-coding RNAs (6S RNA). The feature likely recognizes conserved sequence motifs in tRNA gene promoters, such as the -10/-35 elements or A/B box promoter structures that are critical for transcription by RNA polymerase. This pattern recognition is important for bacterial gene expression regulation, as tRNAs are essential for protein synthesis. The detection pattern is highly consistent across examples, with some variation in activation strength potentially reflecting promoter strength differences or tRNA gene expression levels.",
