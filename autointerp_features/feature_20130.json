{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each activation pattern alongside genomic annotations, looking for correlations between strong activations and specific genes. I identified a consistent pattern where the feature activates strongly over genes annotated as VanW domain-containing proteins (yoaR/vanW genes), which are involved in vancomycin resistance and peptidoglycan binding.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates over yoaR/vanW genes (in sections 0, 2, 6, 9) with strong, continuous activation patterns. In organisms where annotations differ slightly, the feature still activates over proteins with peptidoglycan-binding domains. The feature shows particularly strong activation in several bacterial phyla including Gram-positive bacteria (both high G+C and Firmicutes). The activation pattern spans the entire coding region of these genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects vancomycin resistance proteins with VanW domains across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects genes encoding vancomycin resistance proteins with VanW domains (yoaR/vanW). The activation spans the entire coding region of these genes, suggesting sequence-specific recognition rather than promoter or terminator detection. These proteins are functionally involved in peptidoglycan metabolism and vancomycin resistance, crucial for cell wall integrity. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple bacterial genomes, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria. The feature appears to be taxonomically broad, detecting this important resistance determinant across diverse bacterial lineages.",
