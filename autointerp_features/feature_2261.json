{
  "reasoning": "I examined activation patterns across multiple genomes, focusing on where high activations occur relative to gene annotations. I looked for consistent relationships between activations and specific genomic elements across examples. I paid particular attention to genes near activation peaks and identified common functional themes.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation peaks associated with TCA cycle enzymes and related metabolic genes. In particular, aconitate hydratase (acnA/acnB) appears frequently (sections 2, 8, 3), as do genes for succinate dehydrogenase components (section 8), malate dehydrogenase (section 8), and other components of central carbon metabolism. The activations appear within the coding sequences of these genes rather than at regulatory regions. Most observed organisms are proteobacteria, particularly beta-proteobacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently captures sequences associated with TCA cycle enzymes, primarily aconitase and related metabolic genes.",

  "description": "This feature detects coding sequences within TCA cycle enzymes, particularly aconitate hydratase (acnA/acnB). It shows strong activations across the coding regions of these genes, suggesting it captures sequence motifs specific to these enzymes rather than regulatory elements. Other TCA cycle-related enzymes like succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and citrate lyase also show activations. This pattern likely represents conserved protein domains or sequence motifs in these metabolically critical enzymes. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple examples, mainly in proteobacteria (particularly beta-proteobacteria), indicating evolutionary conservation of these essential metabolic components.",
