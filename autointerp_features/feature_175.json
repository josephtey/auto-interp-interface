  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example looking for patterns in feature activation relative to gene annotations. I observed that in all examples, the strongest activation peaks occur near specific bacterial/archaeal genes related to motility, chemotaxis and/or flagellar systems. For instance, in section_1, peak activation coincides with cheA, cheB genes; in section_7, activation peaks near methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (tar); and in section_4, near flagellar genes (fliP, fliO, flgB, flgC). The pattern is consistent across taxonomically diverse organisms, always showing strongest activation near chemotaxis or flagellar genes.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently activates on bacterial and archaeal chemotaxis and flagellar gene clusters. The strongest activation typically appears at or near genes like cheA (chemotaxis protein histidine kinase), cheB (response regulator), tar (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein), or flagellar assembly genes (fli/flg operons). The pattern is remarkably consistent across phylogenetically diverse bacteria and archaea, suggesting this feature detects a fundamental sequence motif or structural element in chemotaxis/flagellar gene regions. These genes coordinate bacterial movement in response to environmental stimuli and are essential for motility.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects bacterial and archaeal chemotaxis and flagellar gene clusters across diverse species.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects bacterial and archaeal chemotaxis and flagellar system genes. It activates most strongly on or near genes encoding core components of the chemotaxis signaling pathway (cheA, cheB, cheW) and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs/tar), which are transmembrane receptors that detect environmental signals. It also activates on flagellar assembly genes (fliA, fliP, flgB, etc.). The feature likely recognizes sequence motifs common to these functionally related genes, possibly regulatory elements or conserved protein domains. This pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla, appearing in Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Archaea, indicating it detects a fundamental aspect of bacterial motility systems. The biological significance relates to bacterial navigation and response to environmental stimuli, a critical function for microbial survival.",
