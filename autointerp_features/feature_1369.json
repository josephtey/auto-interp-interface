  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I noticed consistent strong activation peaks at specific positions across examples, focusing on what genes or elements are located at or near these peaks. I compared the genomic context surrounding activation peaks across all examples to identify common patterns.",
  "findings": "The feature shows distinct, high-amplitude activation peaks across multiple bacterial genomes. In almost all examples, these peaks consistently occur at or near tRNA genes (example 6 shows tRNA-Thr and tRNA-Gln) or at the junction between specific coding sequences. The strongest activation pattern appears in regulatory regions or at gene boundaries where transcriptional regulation might occur. The feature demonstrates particular sensitivity to small, non-coding RNA elements and regions involved in RNA processing or ribosomal function (like the 16S rRNA in example 5).",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects non-coding RNA elements and their surrounding regulatory regions across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and other non-coding RNA elements in bacterial genomes. It shows strong, localized activation spikes directly at or immediately adjacent to tRNA genes (as seen in example 6) and ribosomal RNA genes (16S rRNA in example 5). The feature appears to be sensitive to the unique structural or sequence characteristics of these non-coding RNA elements and their surrounding regulatory regions. This pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and others, suggesting it captures a conserved genomic signature related to RNA processing, translation, or transcriptional regulation. The feature may be identifying promoter elements or terminator sequences associated with these non-coding RNAs, which would be critical for proper expression and processing of these essential elements.",
