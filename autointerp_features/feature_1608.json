{
  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify patterns in where and how strongly the feature activates relative to annotated genomic elements. I tracked specific DNA elements (genes, tRNAs, etc.) located at or near activation peaks, looking for recurring patterns across examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp activation peaks coinciding precisely with tRNA genes across multiple examples. In section_9, strong activations occur at trnG and trnfM. In section_8, peaks align with trnF and trnC. Visual correlation shows the activation pattern is specific to tRNA loci rather than neighboring protein-coding genes. Most examples from Agarivorans albus and Ferrimonas lipolytica (gamma-proteobacteria) demonstrate this pattern. The feature recognition appears to be universal across different tRNA types (Phe, Gly, fMet, Cys) suggesting detection of common tRNA structural elements rather than specific anticodons.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes across examples, representing a biologically meaningful signal for identifying these critical non-coding RNA elements.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes in bacterial genomes, showing strong activation spikes directly over tRNA annotations. It recognizes multiple tRNA types including tRNA-Gly, tRNA-Phe, tRNA-fMet, and tRNA-Cys, suggesting it's capturing universal tRNA structural characteristics rather than specific anticodon features. The pattern is highly consistent in examples from gamma-proteobacteria (especially Agarivorans albus and Ferrimonas lipolytica), appearing as sharp, distinctive spikes that precisely align with tRNA genomic positions. This detection capability has important biological significance as tRNAs are essential for protein translation, serving as adaptor molecules that decode mRNA sequences into amino acids.",
