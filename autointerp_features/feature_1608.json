  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example by examining the activation patterns relative to gene annotations, focusing on where peaks occur and their intensity. I noted the genomic context, gene functions, and consistent patterns across examples. Most examples show strong activation spikes at specific positions relative to particular genes or gene boundaries, with a notable pattern of activation across multiple gamma-proteobacterial genomes.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation spikes at or near exodeoxyribonucleases and related DNA repair/recombination enzymes. Key observations include: activation near recB/recC genes (section_2), strong activation near exodeoxyribonuclease I (sbcB, section_5), activation near RecJ exonuclease (section_6), and near exodeoxyribonuclease V components (section_2). The pattern appears consistently in gamma-proteobacterial genomes, particularly Agarivorans albus. The activation pattern is characterized by sharp, pronounced spikes reaching amplitudes of 4-6 units, suggesting high specificity for these genomic regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects exodeoxyribonuclease genes and related DNA repair/recombination machinery in gamma-proteobacteria.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects exodeoxyribonuclease genes and related DNA repair/recombination machinery in bacterial genomes, particularly gamma-proteobacteria. It shows strong, consistent activation spikes near genes encoding RecB/RecC exodeoxyribonuclease V components, SbcB (exodeoxyribonuclease I), RecJ (single-stranded DNA exonuclease), and other DNA repair enzymes. The feature activates precisely at or near the coding regions of these genes, with highly specific and pronounced activation spikes. The biological function represented is nucleic acid processing and repair, essential for maintaining genome integrity. The pattern is highly consistent across the examples, with strongest representation in Agarivorans albus and other gamma-proteobacterial genomes, suggesting potential taxonomic specificity.",
