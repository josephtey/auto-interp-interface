  "reasoning": "I observed that in every example, there's a sharp, narrow activation spike at a specific position, rather than a broad activation region. These spikes appear to consistently occur at transitions between gene annotations, often at intergenic regions. I carefully examined each activation peak's position relative to neighboring genes and their functions.",
  "findings": "The activation peaks consistently appear at the boundaries between genes, specifically at the intergenic space between divergently oriented genes (genes transcribed in opposite directions). The strongest activation tends to be at regions that likely contain bidirectional promoters for genes with related functions, such as operons or functionally related gene pairs. For example, in section_5, the spike occurs between araJ and trnP; in section_1 between uspA and bioA; in section_7 between scpB and ytfI. Many of these gene pairs are involved in coordinated cellular processes that would benefit from co-regulation.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects intergenic regions containing potential bidirectional promoters between divergently oriented genes, representing a biologically meaningful regulatory pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects intergenic regions between divergently oriented genes that likely contain bidirectional promoters. The activation consistently appears as a sharp spike precisely at the transition point between coding sequences that are transcribed in opposite directions. This pattern represents regulatory regions where RNA polymerase can initiate transcription in both directions, allowing coordinated expression of neighboring genes. The feature works across diverse bacterial phyla, including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and others, suggesting it captures a fundamental genomic organization pattern conserved across bacterial evolution. The biological function represented is transcriptional regulation through shared promoter elements. The pattern is highly consistent across all examined examples, with precise localization at gene boundaries regardless of the specific genes involved.",
