  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully to identify when and where the feature activates in relation to genomic elements. I noticed a consistent pattern of sharp, high-magnitude activation spikes at specific positions. Across examples, these activations showed a clear preference for boundaries between genes, particularly at transitions involving transcriptional regulators.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at gene boundaries involving transcriptional regulators, particularly those in the LuxR family or other regulatory proteins. Examples include activation at: transitions between regulators and neighboring genes (section_3 between LuxR regulator and helD); boundaries involving BadM/Rrf2 family transcriptional regulators (section_9); positions near OmpR/PhoB regulators (section_0); and transitions involving AraC family regulators (section_4). The activation pattern appears as a sharp, high-magnitude spike precisely at these regulatory transitions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects gene boundaries involving transcriptional regulators across diverse bacterial taxa.",

  "description": "This feature detects genomic boundaries between transcriptional regulators and neighboring genes. The activation consistently presents as a sharp, high-magnitude spike at the transition point between these elements. The feature shows particular sensitivity to boundaries involving LuxR family regulators, OmpR/PhoB domain-containing proteins, and other DNA-binding regulatory proteins. This pattern likely represents recognition of sequence motifs associated with transcriptional regulation units, potentially capturing promoter regions or regulatory binding sites at these transitions. The detection is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa, including proteobacteria (Caulobacter), actinobacteria (Rubrobacter), and firmicutes (Clostridium), suggesting it identifies a fundamental architectural element in bacterial genome organization. The feature may be identifying binding site sequences or structural transitions important for transcription initiation.",
