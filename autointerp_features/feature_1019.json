  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify the pattern of feature activation in relation to genomic annotations. I observed strong, consistent activation peaks coinciding with non-coding RNA elements across multiple bacterial genomes. These primarily included tRNA genes and other functional non-coding RNAs like signal recognition particle RNA and regulatory RNAs.",
  "findings": "In all examples with high activation, the feature consistently detects non-coding RNA elements. Specifically: * tRNA genes (examples 3, 8, 9) * signal recognition particle RNA (example 4) * sRNA regulatory elements (example 2) * rRNA (example 6) The activation pattern shows sharp, strong peaks precisely at these non-coding RNA locations across diverse bacterial phyla (\u03b2-proteobacteria, \u03b3-proteobacteria, Firmicutes, CFB group).",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures non-coding RNA elements across bacterial genomes, showing biological significance.",

  "description": "This feature detects non-coding RNA elements in bacterial genomes with high specificity. It shows strong activation directly overlapping with tRNAs, rRNAs, signal recognition particle RNAs, and other regulatory non-coding RNAs. The activation pattern is characterized by sharp, high-amplitude spikes precisely at the non-coding RNA locations. This suggests the feature captures sequence or structural characteristics unique to functional non-coding RNAs, potentially related to their transcription, processing, or functional elements. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria (\u03b2 and \u03b3 classes), Firmicutes, and CFB group bacteria, indicating conservation of these elements across evolutionary distance. The strength of activation varies by RNA type but consistently appears at non-coding RNA annotations.",
