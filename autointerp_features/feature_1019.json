  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genome annotations. I noted activation peak locations, shapes, and their relationship to specific genes. Across examples, I identified recurring patterns in the activation peaks relative to specific genes and their genomic contexts.",
  "findings": "Strong and consistent feature activation occurs at or near the ftsY gene (signal recognition particle-docking protein FtsY) in multiple examples (sections 1, 4, 6). The feature shows high activation peaks specifically at this location across diverse bacterial phyla (\u03b3-proteobacteria, \u03b2-proteobacteria, firmicutes). In organisms where ftsY is present in the viewed region, the feature consistently shows strong activation. Additionally, the activation pattern often extends to neighboring genes in the SRP (Signal Recognition Particle) pathway, particularly when rsmD (16S rRNA methyltransferase) is adjacent to ftsY.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects the ftsY gene and its surrounding genomic context, representing a biologically meaningful pattern for protein secretion and membrane protein targeting machinery.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects the ftsY gene encoding the signal recognition particle-docking protein FtsY, a critical component of the bacterial protein secretion pathway. The feature shows strong, localized activation directly at the ftsY gene location. FtsY functions as a receptor for the signal recognition particle (SRP), which targets ribosomes synthesizing membrane proteins to the plasma membrane. The detection pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla (proteobacteria and firmicutes), suggesting this represents a conserved sequence motif or structural element within the ftsY gene. The feature occasionally shows secondary activation when other SRP pathway components (like rsmD) are adjacent, indicating potential sensitivity to the broader SRP pathway genomic context. This detection pattern likely represents recognition of a functionally important sequence critical for bacterial protein targeting and membrane protein insertion.",
