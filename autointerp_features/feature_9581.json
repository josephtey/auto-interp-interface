  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to find patterns in feature activation relative to gene annotations. I observed consistent sharp activation spikes near histidine kinase genes and their associated response regulators, which form bacterial two-component signaling systems. The feature activates at specific positions within or at boundaries of these genes, suggesting detection of a conserved sequence motif within these regulatory systems.",
  "findings": "In 8/10 examples, the feature shows strong activation peaks directly associated with histidine kinase genes or at junctions between histidine kinases and response regulators. These activations appear across diverse bacterial phyla (proteobacteria, firmicutes, CFB group). The peak pattern is remarkably consistent - a sharp, high-amplitude spike rather than broad activation, suggesting detection of a specific conserved sequence motif rather than general gene presence.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects a sequence motif specific to bacterial two-component signaling systems, particularly histidine kinases, that is conserved across diverse bacterial taxa.",

  "description": "This feature detects a highly specific sequence motif associated with bacterial two-component signaling systems, particularly within histidine kinase genes or at the junction between histidine kinases and their partner response regulators. The feature activates with a sharp, high-amplitude spike pattern rather than broad activation, indicating recognition of a precise sequence element rather than the general presence of these genes. This motif appears to be evolutionarily conserved across diverse bacterial phyla (proteobacteria, firmicutes, CFB group bacteria), suggesting it may represent a functionally critical sequence within these signaling pathways. Two-component systems are fundamental bacterial regulatory mechanisms that sense and respond to environmental changes, and this feature may capture a key functional or structural element within these systems.",
