  "reasoning": "I analyzed activation patterns across 10 different genomic regions, focusing on where high activation occurs relative to annotated genes. I observed that strong activation clusters consistently appear at the ends of coding regions, often in large multi-spike patterns. By examining the annotations at these regions, I identified that activations predominantly occur near specific gene types and functional regions.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates in regions containing bacterial chemotaxis proteins (MCP/methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins) and sensory transduction systems. Strong activation patterns are seen near tar genes (section_0), methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (sections 3, 5, 7), and signaling/sensory systems like histidine kinases (section_3). The pattern appears at gene boundaries and within these sensory genes, with particularly strong signals at the end/C-terminal regions where sensing domains are often located. These chemotaxis/sensory proteins are crucial for bacterial environmental sensing and movement responses.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects bacterial chemotaxis and sensory transduction components, capturing a biologically significant pattern related to environmental sensing.",

  "description": "This feature consistently detects bacterial methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) and related sensory transduction components like histidine kinases. The activation occurs predominantly at the C-terminal/end regions of these genes, which typically contain the sensory and adaptation domains. This corresponds to the molecular machinery bacteria use to detect and respond to environmental signals like chemical gradients, allowing movement toward attractants or away from repellents. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple examples from diverse bacterial species, especially in proteobacteria (sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6), but also appears in other bacterial phyla like spirochetes and firmicutes. The strong end-region activation suggests the feature may be detecting conserved signaling domains in these environmental response proteins.",
