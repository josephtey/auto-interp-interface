  "reasoning": "I analyzed 10 images showing activation patterns of a sparse autoencoder feature across different enterobacterial genomes. I examined the peak activations relative to gene annotations, comparing the patterns across all examples to identify consistent genomic elements associated with high feature activation.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows high activation patterns directly over or immediately adjacent to RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoD (\u03c370) genes across multiple enterobacterial species. RpoD is the primary sigma factor for RNA polymerase in enterobacteria that directs transcription of housekeeping genes. In several examples (sections 1, 3, 6), there are also consistent activations with tRNA-Ile(cat) in proximity. The activation pattern typically shows strong, continuous signals spanning the rpoD gene, with activation values reaching 3-4 units in intensity. This suggests the feature is detecting specific sequence characteristics of the rpoD gene or its immediate regulatory context in enterobacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects the primary RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoD (\u03c370) across enterobacterial genomes, suggesting biological significance.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects the RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoD (\u03c370) gene in enterobacteria. The feature shows consistent, strong activation directly over the rpoD gene region across multiple examples from various enterobacterial species (Cronobacter, Yersinia, Arsenophonus, etc.). RpoD is the housekeeping sigma factor that enables RNA polymerase to recognize promoter regions of most genes expressed during exponential growth. The pattern is highly specific and conserved, showing continuous strong activation spanning the gene body, suggesting the feature captures evolutionarily conserved sequence characteristics of this essential bacterial transcription factor. The feature's consistent activation across diverse enterobacterial species indicates its detection of fundamental sequence patterns maintained through evolutionary conservation of this essential gene.",
