  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example, identifying the feature's activation pattern and its relationship to genome annotations. I tracked which genes consistently appeared near activation peaks, noting their function, position, and the strength of activation. I then looked for common patterns across all examples, focusing on gene types that repeatedly appeared at or near activation sites.",
  "findings": "Strong activation peaks consistently appear at or near genes encoding 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunits, particularly the beta subunit (porB/korB). In examples 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7, activation spikes directly correspond with por/kor genes. The feature shows sharp, high-intensity spikes rather than broad activation regions. The oxidoreductase genes are critical enzymes in energy metabolism, particularly in anaerobic or thermophilic bacteria, converting 2-oxoacids to their corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives while reducing ferredoxin.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase genes, particularly the beta subunit, across diverse bacterial taxa.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects genes encoding 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzymes, particularly the beta subunit (porB/korB). The activation pattern shows sharp, high-intensity spikes directly over these genes. These enzymes play crucial roles in microbial energy metabolism, especially in anaerobic respiration and fermentation pathways, catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoacids while reducing ferredoxin. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa including firmicutes and other bacterial phyla, suggesting this feature captures a conserved sequence motif within these essential metabolic genes.",
