  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify patterns between the activation peaks and genomic annotations. I noticed that in nearly all examples, strong activation peaks appeared at specific locations that corresponded with non-coding RNA elements like tRNAs, CRISPR spacers, or riboswitches. The feature showed particularly sharp, discrete activation spikes rather than broad regions of activation.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates strongly at RNA-related genomic elements that are not protein-coding genes. In section_1, activation occurs at a tRNA-Ile. In section_8, activation aligns precisely with tRNA-Arg. In sections_6 and _7, activation corresponds with CRISPR spacers. In section_9, activation appears at a cobalamin riboswitch. The feature shows sharp, discrete activation patterns rather than broad regions, suggesting specificity for these RNA elements or their structural characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern related to non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and structured RNA elements like riboswitches and CRISPR spacers.",

  "description": "This feature detects non-coding RNA elements in bacterial and archaeal genomes, particularly tRNAs, riboswitches, and CRISPR spacers. The activation pattern shows sharp, discrete spikes precisely at these RNA elements, suggesting recognition of specific sequence or structural characteristics common to structured non-coding RNAs. The feature likely responds to conserved RNA structural motifs rather than specific sequences, as it activates across diverse organisms (bacteria and archaea). This pattern appears highly consistent across examples, with minimal activation at protein-coding genes, suggesting a specific role in identifying functional RNA elements that may be involved in gene regulation, translation, or defense mechanisms.",
