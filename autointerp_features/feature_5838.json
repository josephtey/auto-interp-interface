  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully to identify patterns in feature activation across different genomic regions. I focused on when and where activation occurs relative to gene annotations, noting sequence context, gene types, and organizational patterns. I compared activations across all examples to find consistent patterns.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation across repetitive protein domains, particularly in surface and adhesion proteins. Examples include RTX proteins (section_2), MSCRAMM family proteins with DEv-IgG fold (section_1), pilin domains (section_1), CS1-pili formation proteins (section_8), and dockerin repeat proteins (section_6). The activation pattern typically appears as multiple spikes across these repeat-containing proteins, suggesting the feature detects amino acid repeat patterns or secondary structural motifs within these surface-related proteins.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects sequence patterns associated with bacterial adhesion and surface proteins containing repetitive domains.",

  "description": "This feature consistently detects repetitive protein domains within bacterial surface and adhesion proteins. It shows strong activation patterns across various organisms for proteins containing tandem repeats, particularly in pili/fimbriae components, adhesins, and extracellular matrix interaction proteins. The feature appears to recognize conserved sequence motifs or structural patterns that form repetitive units in these proteins, which are critical for bacterial attachment to surfaces, host cell recognition, and biofilm formation. The pattern is highly consistent across taxonomically diverse bacteria including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, suggesting the feature detects a fundamental building block of bacterial surface structures that has been evolutionarily conserved.",
