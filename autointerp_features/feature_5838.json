  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example carefully, noting activation patterns and their relationship to genomic annotations. I examined where high activation peaks occur across the 10kb regions in relation to gene structures, observing that most examples show distributed spike patterns rather than continuous activation. In multiple examples, the activation appears within or near specific coding sequences (CDS) with no clear pattern related to gene function. The activation varies across genomic contexts - some show strong continuous activation across large regions (examples 1, 8), others show clustered spikes (examples 0, 4, 5, 9), and some show isolated spikes (example 3). No consistent relationship to particular gene families, regulatory elements, or structural motifs is evident.",
  "findings": "The feature demonstrates varied activation patterns associated with coding sequences but lacks consistent specificity to particular gene types or functions. Looking across examples, I found no predominant gene family, regulatory element, or structural motif that could explain the activation pattern. The feature activates in diverse genomic contexts including metabolic genes, transporters, transcriptional regulators, and hypothetical proteins. While some examples show strong activation near tRNA genes (examples 2, 9), others have no such association. The feature may be detecting some underlying sequence pattern common to different types of genes, but no clear biological significance emerges from this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The feature appears to detect a general property of coding sequences rather than a specific biological element or motif.",

  "description": "This feature appears to detect general properties common to various coding sequences rather than a specific gene type or functional element. The activation pattern shows distributed spikes of varying intensity across diverse genomic regions containing coding sequences. The feature activates across functionally diverse genes including metabolic enzymes, transporters, regulatory proteins, and hypothetical proteins with no apparent preference for specific gene families. In some examples, it shows activation near tRNA genes, while in others it activates within protein-coding genes of various functions. The lack of consistent relationship to specific gene types or genomic elements suggests this feature may be detecting fundamental sequence characteristics common to coding regions, possibly related to codon usage patterns or general sequence composition properties that distinguish coding from non-coding DNA. The inconsistent nature of the activation makes it difficult to assign a specific biological function to this feature.",
