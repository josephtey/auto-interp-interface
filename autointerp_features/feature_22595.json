  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across multiple genomic regions, focusing on where peaks occur in relation to annotated genes. I noticed strong and consistent activation at specific genomic elements across different Rhizobiales bacteria (primarily Allorhizobium pseudoryzae). By comparing activation patterns with gene annotations, I identified common elements where activation consistently occurs.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong activation near transitions between genes and at the 3' end of genes, particularly at the end of ABC transporters, membrane proteins, and cellular machinery proteins. The highest activation peaks (values 3-4) consistently appear at gene boundaries, especially where genes meet in convergent or divergent orientations. This pattern is particularly pronounced in examples where adjacent genes have different functions or are transcribed in opposite directions, suggesting the feature may detect specific termination signals, intergenic regions, or regulatory elements between functionally distinct genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects genomic transition points between genes, particularly at functional boundaries in Alphaproteobacteria.",

  "description": "This feature detects gene boundaries and transition zones between genes, particularly at the convergence of genes with different functions. It consistently activates at 3' ends of genes where they meet intergenic regions or adjacent genes, with strongest signals at convergent gene arrangements. The pattern suggests recognition of termination signals, transcriptional boundary elements, or regulatory intergenic regions that separate functionally distinct genomic units. The feature likely identifies important functional transitions in genome organization essential for proper gene expression regulation. The pattern is highly consistent across examples and appears specific to Alphaproteobacteria, particularly Allorhizobium species, suggesting it captures taxon-specific genomic organization elements.",
