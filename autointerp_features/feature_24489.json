  "reasoning": "I analyzed all examples to identify patterns in feature activation, focusing on spike locations relative to genomic annotations. I examined recurring gene types, positioning patterns, and functional relationships between genes where activation occurs.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently shows sharp spike activations near or at gene junctions, particularly where a mobile genetic element or DNA modification enzyme is present. In multiple examples (2, 6, 8), HNH endonucleases, site-specific recombinases, or transposases are found near activation sites. Several instances show activation near phage-related genes or DNA rearrangement elements. The feature appears to detect sequence characteristics common at gene boundaries involving mobile genetic elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture biologically meaningful sequence patterns associated with mobile genetic element insertion sites.",

  "description": "This feature detects sequence characteristics at gene junctions where mobile genetic elements are inserted. It shows consistent single spike activation at these boundaries, particularly near genes encoding HNH endonucleases, transposases, integrases, or phage-related elements. In example 2, activation occurs near phage terminase and HNH endonuclease genes. In example 6, activation is near site-specific DNA recombinase SpoIVCA. The pattern suggests recognition of sequence motifs associated with insertion sites where DNA rearrangement has occurred. These sites likely share distinctive sequence signatures despite different genomic contexts. The feature activates across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes, indicating a conserved sequence pattern at mobile genetic element boundaries.",
