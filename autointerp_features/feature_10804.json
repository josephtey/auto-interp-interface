  "reasoning": "I examined each example to identify patterns in the activation peaks, focusing on their relationship to genome annotations. I observed consistent patterns of strong, continuous activation over specific genomic regions rather than at specific annotated elements. The activation blocks appear in different organisms but show similarity in pattern.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows high activation across blocks of genomic sequences that appear to be hypothetical proteins or unannotated regions in most cases. In several examples (sections 1, 2, 4, 8), the feature activates strongly across what are labeled as hypothetical proteins. The activation pattern is characterized by sustained high values across continuous regions rather than specific spikes at gene boundaries. The pattern does not consistently correspond to known functional genes across examples.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect a sequence composition pattern characteristic of certain genomic regions, likely representing a specific nucleotide or codon bias that occurs in hypothetical/novel gene regions.",
  "title": "Hypothetical protein sequence detector",
  "activation-pattern": "continuous",
  "description": "This feature detects extended regions of specific sequence composition that frequently occur in regions annotated as hypothetical proteins. The activation is characterized by strong, continuous signal blocks rather than discrete points, suggesting the feature is responding to sequence composition properties rather than specific motifs. The consistent activation across these regions in diverse organisms (including archaea and bacteria) suggests it may be detecting a universal property of certain coding sequences, possibly novel genes with distinct composition bias. This could represent regions with unusual GC content, codon usage patterns, or other sequence-level properties that distinguish them from well-characterized genes. The pattern is broadly distributed across diverse taxa.",
