  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully, noting the activation patterns and their relationship to genomic annotations. The feature shows distributed, frequent spike-like activations across diverse genomic regions in bacterial genomes. The activations don't appear to correlate with specific gene families or functional categories. Instead, I observed relatively uniform distribution of activation spikes throughout coding sequences (CDS) regions across different bacterial genes with varied functions (enzymes, transporters, regulatory proteins, structural proteins, etc.). The activation pattern appears to be detecting general properties of protein-coding sequences rather than specific gene functions or motifs.",
  "findings": "The feature shows consistent spike-like activations throughout coding regions regardless of gene function. Examples include: wrbA (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase), rnpA (ribonuclease P), rnr (ribonuclease R), hypothetical proteins, transporters, regulatory proteins, and various metabolic enzymes. The activation appears to be sensitive to aspects of coding sequence structure common across bacterial genes. The pattern suggests detection of codon usage patterns, ribosome binding sites, or other universal features of bacterial coding sequences. Notably, the feature does not show preferential activation in non-coding regions like CRISPR repeats/spacers.",
  "conclusion": "The feature captures a general property of bacterial protein-coding sequences that transcends specific gene functions.",

  "description": "This feature detects fundamental structural properties common to bacterial protein-coding sequences (CDS). The activation pattern shows consistent distributed spikes throughout coding regions regardless of the specific gene function - whether metabolic enzymes, transporters, regulatory proteins, or hypothetical proteins. The feature likely responds to conserved characteristics of bacterial coding sequences such as codon usage patterns, open reading frame structure, or common sequence motifs that facilitate translation. The consistent activation across functionally diverse genes from different bacterial species suggests it captures a universal property of prokaryotic coding sequence organization. This pattern is highly consistent across all examples, with visibly similar activation distributions in coding regions regardless of the gene's function or the organism's taxonomy.",
