  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all 10 examples, focusing on the genomic annotations at locations with high feature activation. I examined the gene content, positional relationships, and common elements across different organisms. I noticed that RTX toxin-related proteins and various secretion system components appeared frequently in regions with strong activation.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently activates across large genes encoding RTX toxin-related proteins and Ca2+-binding domains. In Desulfomicrobium baculatum examples (sections 0, 1, 2), the strongest activations occur within very large Ca2+-binding RTX toxin-related genes. In other organisms, activations correlate with secretion system components, particularly those involved in type II, IV, and VII secretion pathways. The feature shows a distributed activation pattern throughout these large genes rather than at specific boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects RTX toxin-related proteins and secretion system components across diverse bacterial species.",

  "description": "This feature detects large genes encoding RTX toxin-related proteins and various bacterial secretion system components. It shows distributed activation throughout these genes rather than at specific boundaries or motifs. RTX (Repeats in ToXin) proteins contain characteristic glycine-rich nonapeptide repeats that bind calcium ions and are often associated with type I secretion systems. The consistent activation across diverse bacterial species (particularly Desulfomicrobium baculatum) suggests this feature detects conserved sequence characteristics of these large, repetitive toxin genes and related secretion machinery. The biological function relates to bacterial toxin production and secretion, which are important virulence factors in many bacterial pathogens.",
