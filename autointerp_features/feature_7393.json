  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify patterns in the sparse autoencoder feature activations across genomic regions. The most striking observation is the consistent appearance of sharp activation spikes that occur precisely at or very near tRNA genes in multiple examples. Specifically, in section_0.png, section_4.png, section_5.png, and section_9.png, there are clear activations at tRNA annotations (IDs 7, 13, 6, and 8 respectively). The activation pattern is remarkably similar across these examples - a sharp, distinct spike rather than a broad activation region.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently activates at tRNA genes across different genomic contexts and organisms. In section_0.png, the activation coincides with tRNA-His(gtg); in section_4.png with tRNA-Ile(gat); in section_5.png with tRNA-Lys(ttt); and in section_9.png with tRNA-Thr(tgt). The feature appears to specifically recognize tRNA genes regardless of their anticodon specificities. The activation is precisely localized to the tRNA position rather than neighboring elements, suggesting sensitivity to the characteristic structural elements of tRNA genes. In section_7.png, where we see activation near CRISPR elements, this may represent detection of RNA structural elements with similar features.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with tRNA genes across diverse genomic contexts.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes in bacterial genomes. It produces sharp, distinct activation spikes precisely at the location of tRNA genes regardless of their anticodon specificity (detecting tRNA-His, tRNA-Ile, tRNA-Lys, and tRNA-Thr in different examples). The feature likely recognizes the distinctive cloverleaf secondary structure elements or sequence motifs characteristic of tRNA genes, such as the conserved T-loop, D-loop, or promoter elements. The detection is highly specific and position-sensitive, with activation occurring directly at the tRNA gene location rather than spreading into adjacent regions. This feature could play an important biological role in identifying non-coding RNA genes with specific structural properties within bacterial genomes. The pattern is consistently observed across multiple examples and genomic contexts.",
