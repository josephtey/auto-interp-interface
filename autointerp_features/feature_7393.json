  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I observed that in all examples, there's a single sharp spike of activation consistently positioned at or near tRNA genes when present, or at specific locations that might contain similar structural elements.",
  "findings": "In multiple examples (sections 2, 7, 9), the feature strongly activates precisely at tRNA genes (tRNA-Phe, tRNA-Trp, tRNA-Val). In other examples without annotated tRNAs, the feature shows similar sharp activation patterns that could indicate unannotated tRNAs or structurally similar RNA elements. The feature appears to detect a specific structural motif common to tRNAs rather than specific gene sequences, as it fires across different tRNA types and in diverse bacterial phyla.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects tRNA genes or similar RNA structural elements across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and possibly similar structured RNA elements. It produces sharp, high-magnitude activation spikes precisely at tRNA locations when annotated, regardless of the specific tRNA type (Phe, Trp, Val, Asn). The consistent activation pattern across diverse bacterial phyla (including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Mycoplasmas) suggests it recognizes a conserved structural aspect of tRNAs rather than sequence-specific motifs. This structural recognition is crucial for biological functions requiring tRNA identification. The feature shows high specificity with almost no background noise, making it an excellent marker for tRNA locations in genomic sequences.",
