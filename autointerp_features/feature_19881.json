  "reasoning": "I analyzed multiple genomic regions from Ferrovibrio terrae, examining the activation patterns and their relationship to annotated genes. For each example, I identified where the feature showed high activation and which gene annotations corresponded to these regions. The consistent pattern across examples revealed the feature primarily activates across protein-coding genes in this bacterial genome, with particularly strong signals across housekeeping genes and operons involved in essential cellular functions.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, continuous activation across protein-coding regions of the Ferrovibrio terrae genome. This activation pattern spans diverse functional gene categories including ribosomal proteins, DNA replication/repair proteins, cell division proteins, membrane/cell wall biosynthesis genes, and flagellar proteins. Notably, the feature activates strongly across operons containing multiple consecutive coding sequences, with minimal activation in intergenic regions. The signal drops sharply at gene boundaries, suggesting this feature is detecting general protein-coding potential rather than specific gene functions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern representing protein-coding regions in bacterial genomes, specifically in Ferrovibrio terrae.",

  "description": "This feature detects protein-coding regions within the Ferrovibrio terrae genome, with continuous strong activation across coding sequences (CDS). The feature shows minimal activation in intergenic regions and non-coding elements, with sharp transitions at gene boundaries. It appears to be a general protein-coding detector rather than targeting specific gene families, functioning across diverse operons including those for ribosomal proteins, DNA replication/repair enzymes, cell division proteins, membrane biosynthesis genes, and flagellar components. The pattern is highly consistent across all examples, suggesting this feature serves as a fundamental detector of translated regions in bacterial genomes, particularly in alpha-proteobacteria like Ferrovibrio terrae.",
