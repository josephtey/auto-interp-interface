  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across multiple genomic sequences from different organisms, focusing on when and where the feature showed high activation. I analyzed the spatial relationship between activation peaks and genome annotations, looking for consistent patterns across examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp, localized activation spikes associated with non-coding RNA elements, particularly structured RNAs. In section_1.png, the feature activates near \"RNaseP_arch: Archaeal RNase P (ncRNA)\". In section_0.png, activation appears near \"C4: C4 antisense RNA\". The pattern is highly specific, showing precise and discrete peaks rather than broad activation regions. These activation spikes appear to detect structured RNA motifs involved in RNA processing or regulation, regardless of the surrounding genomic context or organism type.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures biologically meaningful structured non-coding RNA elements across diverse organisms.",
  "title": "Structured non-coding RNA element detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects structured non-coding RNA elements, particularly RNase P RNA and other functional non-coding RNAs. The feature produces sharp, precise activation spikes directly at the location of these RNA elements. These structured RNAs typically function in RNA processing, such as tRNA maturation (RNase P) or antisense regulation (C4 RNA). The pattern is highly consistent across examples where these elements appear, though not all genomic regions contain such elements. The feature activates in diverse organisms spanning bacteria and archaea, suggesting it detects conserved RNA structural motifs rather than sequence-specific patterns.",
