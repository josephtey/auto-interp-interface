  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all examples, noting their precise positions relative to genome annotations. For each activation peak, I identified the corresponding gene or element and looked for patterns in peak location, strength, and genomic context.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, sharp activation spikes at specific genomic locations across diverse bacterial species. In most examples, these activation peaks occur within or at the boundaries of DNA/RNA helicase genes or related nucleic acid processing enzymes. Examples include recD helicase (section_6), DNA 3'-5' helicase (section_5), DEAD/DEAH box helicase (section_5), histidine kinase (section_0), and various other nucleic acid binding proteins or enzymes involved in DNA repair, recombination, or transcriptional regulation.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects a conserved sequence motif or structural element associated with helicase genes and related nucleic acid processing enzymes across diverse bacterial species.",
  "title": "Helicase/nucleic acid processing gene detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif or structural element commonly found in bacterial helicase genes and related nucleic acid processing enzymes. The activation pattern shows consistent sharp spikes within or at the boundaries of these genes across phylogenetically diverse bacteria. The feature appears to recognize a functionally important sequence signature associated with enzymes that manipulate DNA or RNA structure, particularly those involved in unwinding, repair, recombination, or transcriptional regulation. The pattern is highly consistent across examples and appears to be conserved across multiple bacterial phyla, suggesting it detects an evolutionarily conserved element with important functional significance in nucleic acid metabolism.",
