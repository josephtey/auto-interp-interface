  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in the feature activation. In 8 out of 10 examples, I observed sharp, narrow activation spikes at specific genomic locations. I examined adjacent gene annotations to determine what genomic elements might be triggering these activations. A notable pattern emerged where most activations occur at the junction between genes, particularly at transcriptional regulator boundaries. I paid special attention to gene functions and their relationship to the activation sites.",
  "findings": "The most consistent pattern observed is activation at or near transcriptional regulators of various families (AraC, LuxR, OmpR, RpiR, TetR). In section_0, activation occurs near an AraC family regulator. Section_2 shows activation near an RpiR family regulator. Section_4 shows activation near OmpR and LuxR family regulators. Section_5 shows activation at CRISPR-Cas boundaries. The feature appears to detect DNA binding motifs or promoter regions associated with these regulatory elements. The activation is consistently a sharp spike rather than a broad region, suggesting sequence-specific recognition of regulatory motifs.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects specific regulatory elements across bacterial genomes, particularly transcriptional regulator binding sites.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects DNA sequences associated with transcriptional regulators and their binding sites across diverse bacterial genomes. The activations consistently appear at or near genes encoding regulatory proteins including AraC, LuxR, OmpR, RpiR, and TetR family transcription factors. The sharp, localized spikes suggest the feature recognizes specific regulatory motifs rather than coding sequences themselves. This likely corresponds to promoter regions or operator sites where these regulators bind to control gene expression. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria) suggesting conservation of regulatory DNA motifs. The biological function appears to involve detection of DNA binding and transcription regulation sites that control bacterial gene expression networks.",
