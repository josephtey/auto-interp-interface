  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify correlation patterns between feature activations and genome annotations. I noted that strong activation peaks consistently appear at or near genes involved in tRNA modification, particularly those encoding enzymes that modify tRNAs at specific positions. The most prominent pattern was activation associated with tRNA glutamyl-Q synthetase (gluQRS).",
  "findings": "In multiple examples (sections 1, 3, 5), the feature shows strong activation specifically at the gluQRS gene, which encodes the tRNA glutamyl-Q(34) synthetase. This enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of queuosine at position 34 of tRNA. Similar activation patterns appear near other tRNA modification enzymes across different bacterial species. The feature appears to be detecting conserved sequences in tRNA modification genes across diverse bacterial taxa including Enterobacteria, Proteobacteria, and CFB group bacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects genomic regions containing tRNA glutamyl-Q synthetase and related tRNA modification genes.",
  "title": "tRNA modification enzyme detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA glutamyl-Q synthetase (gluQRS) genes and occasionally other tRNA modification enzymes. The activation pattern shows sharp spikes directly over the gluQRS gene location in Enterobacteria (Serratia, Klebsiella) and other bacterial genomes. The feature likely recognizes conserved sequence motifs in these genes that are essential for tRNA modification, particularly the incorporation of modified nucleosides at specific tRNA positions. This suggests the feature is detecting a highly conserved bacterial function related to translation fidelity. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa, indicating evolutionary conservation of these sequences.",
