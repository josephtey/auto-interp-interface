  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns of feature activation across the genome annotations. I observed that the feature consistently shows strong activation spikes at specific genomic locations, typically towards the end of the visible region in most examples. I looked for correlations between these activation peaks and gene annotations, examining the precise positions, gene types, and biological functions.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at or near tRNA genes in several examples. In section_1, the peak aligns with the 5S ribosomal RNA (rrf) gene. In section_9, activation occurs at tRNA-Gln and tRNA-Ser genes. Other examples don't show tRNA annotations directly, but the activation pattern is consistent - sharp, distinctive spikes at specific locations that may represent unannotated RNA genes or RNA-associated elements. The locations are often near chromosome replication or RNA processing genes, suggesting a possible relationship to RNA biogenesis or regulation.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with non-coding RNA genes, particularly tRNA and rRNA elements.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects non-coding RNA genes, particularly tRNAs and rRNAs, in bacterial genomes. It shows sharp, distinct activation spikes directly at or near RNA gene locations. The feature appears to be sensitive to structural or sequence characteristics unique to non-coding RNA elements, possibly detecting promoter regions or specific secondary structure signals. The pattern is highly consistent across different bacterial species, including enterobacteria (Yersinia, Serratia, Arsenophonus), \u03b3-proteobacteria (Aliivibrio, Agarivorans), and other bacterial phyla, suggesting it detects a fundamental and conserved feature of bacterial RNA genes.",
