  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, focusing on when and where the feature activates strongly. I observed consistent patterns of high feature activation across protein-coding sequences (CDS) in bacterial genomes, with clear drops in activation at non-coding regions (gaps). The activation shows strong, continuous patterns spanning entire genes, with sharp boundaries corresponding to gene borders.",
  "findings": "The feature shows high activation across a wide variety of protein-coding genes regardless of their specific function (transporters, enzymes, regulatory proteins, etc.). Activation strength is consistently high (typically 4-6 units) throughout coding regions and drops dramatically to near zero in intergenic regions. The pattern is remarkably consistent across different bacterial genomes and gene types. When multiple genes are present, the activation maintains similar intensity across all coding regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly identifies protein-coding regions in bacterial genomes, serving as a general coding sequence detector.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects protein-coding sequences (CDS) in bacterial genomes. It activates strongly and continuously throughout entire genes regardless of their functional class or specific sequence content. The feature shows consistent high activation (4-6 units) across diverse genes including transporters, enzymes, regulatory proteins, and hypothetical proteins, while dropping to near zero in intergenic regions. This pattern likely represents the general characteristics of bacterial coding DNA, such as codon usage bias, GC content, or other sequence properties that distinguish coding from non-coding regions. The remarkable consistency across functionally diverse genes suggests this feature captures fundamental properties of bacterial protein-coding sequences rather than specific gene functions or families. This detector would be valuable for gene prediction and annotation in bacterial genomes.",
