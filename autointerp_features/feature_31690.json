{
  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all examples, identifying consistent spatial relationships between feature activations and gene annotations. The feature shows strong, continuous activation across coding sequences with distinct gaps at gene boundaries. All examples are from Janthinobacterium agaricidamnosum, showing this feature is specific to this organism.",
  "findings": "The feature activates strongly within protein-coding sequences (CDS) and stops at gene boundaries, creating a pattern of continuous activation blocks interrupted by sharp drops. The feature is consistently present in diverse functional genes (including metabolic enzymes, membrane proteins, chaperones, flagellar components) with no obvious preference for specific gene families or functions. It appears to detect generic coding regions rather than specific gene families or regulatory elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a fundamental property of protein-coding sequences in Janthinobacterium agaricidamnosum, likely detecting sequence composition characteristic of CDS regions.",

  "description": "This feature detects protein-coding sequences (CDS) in Janthinobacterium agaricidamnosum, showing strong continuous activation throughout coding regions with sharp boundaries at gene starts/ends. The feature activates regardless of gene function (flagellar proteins, chaperones, transporters, enzymes), suggesting it recognizes fundamental properties of coding sequences like codon usage or GC content rather than specific gene families. The consistent activation pattern across diverse genes indicates the feature is capturing inherent properties of this organism's coding regions, potentially useful for gene prediction or distinguishing coding from non-coding regions. The feature is highly specific to Janthinobacterium agaricidamnosum.",
