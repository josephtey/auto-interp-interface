{
  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all examples to identify common genomic elements. I focused on where the feature shows high activation (blue peaks) and analyzed the corresponding genes/annotations at these locations.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates on immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain-containing proteins. In sections 4, 6, and 9, continuous high activation spans directly over annotated Ig-like domain proteins. Section 2 shows activation over Big-1 domain (a type of Ig-like domain) protein. Some activation also occurs in regions with cell surface proteins, transposases, bacteriocins, and leukocidin/hemolysin toxin families, which often contain Ig-like folds.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects Ig-like domain-containing proteins across diverse bacterial genomes, likely recognizing characteristic sequence patterns of these widespread structural folds.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain-containing proteins across bacterial genomes. The feature shows strong, continuous activation directly over genes annotated as containing Ig-like domains or similar \u03b2-sandwich folds. These domains are structurally important components found in many bacterial cell surface proteins, adhesins, and other proteins involved in cellular interactions. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacteria (including Thiospirochaeta, Symbiobacterium, Nocardioides, Atribacter). The feature may be recognizing the characteristic sequence patterns that encode the \u03b2-sheet secondary structures forming the Ig-like fold. This suggests the feature is capturing a conserved structural motif rather than specific protein functions, as Ig-like domains appear in proteins with diverse roles including cell adhesion, pathogenicity, and molecular recognition.",
