  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, focusing on their positions relative to genome annotations. I noticed a consistent pattern where the feature strongly activates in proximity to genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, particularly murC and murB genes. These genes encode enzymes in the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis pathway.",
  "findings": "In multiple examples (sections 0, 8, 9), the feature shows strong activation directly over or adjacent to murC (UDP-N-acetylmuramate--L-alanine ligase) and murB (UDP-N-acetylmuramate dehydrogenase) genes. Additional examples show activation near other cell wall synthesis genes like UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate--2,6-diaminopimelate ligase (sections 3, 7). The feature consistently activates in bacterial genomes with peptidoglycan synthesis machinery, particularly the cytoplasmic steps of cell wall precursor synthesis.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects sequences associated with bacterial cell wall biosynthesis genes, particularly murB/murC operons.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects genomic regions containing murB and murC genes, which encode key enzymes in bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The feature shows strong, localized activation directly over or immediately adjacent to these genes across diverse bacterial phyla. These genes catalyze essential early steps in cell wall precursor synthesis: MurB reduces UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvate to UDP-N-acetylmuramate, while MurC adds L-alanine to UDP-N-acetylmuramate. The feature appears most active in bacteria with peptidoglycan cell walls and shows consistent activation patterns regardless of neighboring genes, suggesting it's detecting conserved sequence features within murB/murC themselves rather than operon context. The consistency across phylogenetically diverse organisms indicates these sequences are highly conserved due to their essential function in bacterial cell wall synthesis.",
