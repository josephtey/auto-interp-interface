{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example individually, looking for patterns in where the feature activates in relation to nearby genomic elements. The feature consistently shows strong, sharp activation spikes near or overlapping with membrane transport proteins, particularly MMPL family transporters and ABC transporters.",
  "findings": "In examples 0, 2, 7, the feature activates directly at MMPL family transporters. In examples 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, it activates at or near ABC transporters or other membrane transport proteins (RND exporter, etc.). The activation is consistently a sharp, strong spike rather than a broad pattern. The feature appears to be detecting specific membrane transporter elements, particularly in diverse bacterial species.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures membrane transport proteins across multiple bacterial phyla, with particular affinity for MMPL and ABC transporter families.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects membrane transporter proteins in bacterial genomes, with highest activation for MMPL family transporters and various ABC transporters. The feature produces sharp, strong activation spikes directly at the transporter gene locations. This pattern likely represents recognition of conserved sequence motifs within these transporter genes that are critical for membrane transport functions. The pattern is highly consistent across examples and spans diverse bacterial phyla including Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, indicating evolutionary conservation of these transport mechanisms. The feature might be recognizing a specific domain structure or sequence signature common to prokaryotic membrane transport systems.",
