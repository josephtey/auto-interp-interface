{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across multiple genomic examples, focusing on where the feature activates strongly in relation to the annotated genes and genomic elements. I paid particular attention to consistent patterns of activation positions, examining both the specific types of genes/elements where activation occurs and the nature of activation (sharp spikes vs. continuous patterns).",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp spike activations at or near non-coding RNA genes and RNA-related elements. In section_6, activation occurs directly at trnD (tRNA-Asp). In section_1, activation appears near RNaseP_bact_a (bacterial RNase P). In sections_3 and_8, activations appear near CRISPR elements. The activation pattern is highly specific, producing sharp, distinct peaks rather than broad regions of activation, suggesting recognition of specific sequence motifs or structural elements common to RNA genes or RNA processing sites.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern related to RNA genes and RNA processing sites.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific non-coding RNA genes and RNA processing elements, particularly tRNAs and RNase P RNA. It produces sharp, high-magnitude activation spikes precisely at or near these elements. The feature likely recognizes conserved sequence motifs or structural characteristics common to various RNA genes. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with activation occurring at or near tRNA genes, RNase P RNA, and CRISPR-associated RNA elements. This suggests the feature is identifying fundamental RNA structural or sequence components essential for RNA processing and function across different bacterial genomes.",
