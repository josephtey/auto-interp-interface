  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, looking for consistent relationships between high activation spikes and specific genomic elements. I observed that strong, sharp activation spikes consistently appear in proximity to transport-related genes, particularly energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters and related components.",
  "findings": "The feature shows sharp, discrete activation spikes near genes encoding ECF transporter components (ecfT) and related transport systems including ABC transporters, transmembrane components, and substrate-binding proteins. In examples 1, 3, 6, and others, the activation consistently occurs near ECF transporter components or related transport machinery. The pattern shows taxonomic diversity, appearing in various bacterial phyla including proteobacteria, firmicutes, and actinobacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects sequences associated with energy-coupling factor transporters and related bacterial transport systems.",

  "description": "This feature detects genomic regions encoding energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters and related transport components in bacterial genomes. It consistently activates with sharp spikes near genes encoding ECF transporter transmembrane proteins (ecfT) and associated ABC transporter components. The feature appears to recognize sequence characteristics of these specialized transport systems, which are involved in the uptake of trace nutrients like vitamins and metal ions. The activation pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa, showing strong signals in proteobacteria, firmicutes, and actinobacteria, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved sequence signature for this important class of bacterial transporters.",
