{
  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all 10 genomic examples, focusing on where the feature shows high activation intensity and its positional relationship to annotated genomic elements. I noted the genomic context in each case, looking for recurring patterns.",
  "findings": "In nearly all examples, the feature shows strong, discrete activation peaks. These peaks consistently appear at or near annotated tRNA genes or RNA-related elements. For example, in section_3, the strongest activation directly overlaps with trnD (tRNA-Asp). In section_2, activation occurs near a TPP riboswitch (RNA regulatory element). In sections_7 and 8, activation is near CRISPR repeats (RNA-based immune system components). The feature shows strong, localized activation specifically at these non-coding RNA elements across diverse bacterial species.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and RNA-based regulatory structures, across diverse bacterial genomes.",
  "title": "Non-coding RNA element detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects non-coding RNA elements, primarily tRNAs and structured RNA elements like riboswitches and CRISPR repeats. The activation typically shows as sharp, localized spikes directly overlapping these RNA elements. The feature appears to recognize structural or sequence characteristics common to functional non-coding RNAs despite their diverse sequences. This pattern is highly consistent across examples from different bacterial phyla (firmicutes, cyanobacteria, proteobacteria), suggesting it detects fundamental RNA features conserved across bacterial domains. The feature likely contributes to identifying functional RNA elements that play crucial roles in translation, regulation, and bacterial immune responses.",
