  "reasoning": "I analyzed patterns across 10 genomic regions, focusing on where feature activation peaks occurred in relation to annotated elements. I examined activation strength, pattern shape, and genomic context for each peak, then looked for common patterns across examples.",
  "findings": "The strongest activations consistently occur near non-coding RNA (ncRNA) elements or at transitions between coding and non-coding regions. Examples include Acido-Lenti-1 RNA in section_1, rrl (23S rRNA) in section_5, and Flavo-1 RNA in section_0. When ncRNAs aren't present, activation often appears at boundaries between different types of genes or at domain interfaces. The feature appears most active in bacterial genomes, particularly in Bacteroidetes/Flavobacteria/CFB group and similar taxa.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects structural transitions in bacterial genomes, particularly associated with non-coding RNA elements and gene boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature primarily detects bacterial non-coding RNA elements and gene boundaries. It shows strong activation at or near characterized ncRNAs (23S rRNA, Acido-Lenti-1, Flavo-1) and at transition regions between coding sequences. The feature may be recognizing structural or compositional shifts that occur at these boundaries, potentially identifying regulatory elements or genome organizational features. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with strongest activations associated with ncRNAs when present, and domain/gene transitions otherwise. The feature appears most active in bacterial genomes, particularly those from Bacteroidetes/CFB group and related phyla, suggesting evolutionary conservation of these structural patterns in these bacterial lineages.",
