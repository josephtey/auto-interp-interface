  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify patterns of feature activation in relation to genes or genetic elements. I observed strong, consistent activation peaks associated with specific energy metabolism genes across multiple bacteria, particularly focusing on patterns that appeared repeatedly.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong activation near genes involved in energy metabolism, particularly ATP synthase subunits, electron transfer flavoproteins, and oxidative phosphorylation components. In example 1, strong peaks occur at ATP synthase (atpA, atpG, atpD) genes. In example 4, activation appears at Asp-tRNA(Asn)/Glu-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase genes (gatA). Example 5 shows peaks near electron transfer flavoproteins (fixA, fixB). Example 8 shows activation at sulfate adenylyltransferase genes (cysN). Example 9 shows activation at 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase genes, further supporting association with energy metabolism.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects bacterial genes involved in cellular energy production and electron transfer.",
  "title": "Bacterial Energy Metabolism Gene Detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects genes involved in bacterial energy metabolism pathways, particularly ATP synthase subunits, electron transfer flavoproteins, and oxidative phosphorylation components. The feature shows strong spike-like activation patterns within or at boundaries of these genes. It appears to recognize sequence motifs common across diverse bacterial energy production systems, suggesting a role in detecting conserved functional domains within energy metabolism machinery. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from different bacterial phyla including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, indicating it's detecting fundamental bacterial energy metabolism elements rather than taxon-specific patterns.",
