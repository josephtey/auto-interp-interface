  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example's activation patterns, noting where strong signals appeared in relation to genomic annotations. I observed consistent elevated activations across phage-related regions and mobile genetic elements across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes. Most examples showed strong activations spanning multiple phage structural genes, integrases, terminases, and DNA-binding regulatory elements.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently detects regions containing phage-related genes and mobile genetic elements. The activation spans entire prophage regions, with particularly strong signals around structural components (capsid, terminase, portal proteins), integrases/recombinases (XerD), and regulatory elements (AlpA). The feature activates across evolutionarily diverse hosts (proteobacteria, archaea) but always in regions with phage-like genetic organization.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures integrated prophage regions across diverse prokaryotic genomes, likely identifying characteristic sequence patterns of horizontally transferred genetic material.",

  "description": "This feature detects integrated prophage regions in bacterial and archaeal genomes. It shows strong continuous activation across complete prophage insertions, spanning genes encoding structural components (capsid, terminase, portal proteins), DNA manipulation enzymes (integrases, recombinases), and regulatory elements. The activation pattern is highly consistent across taxonomically diverse prokaryotes (proteobacteria, euryarchaeotes), suggesting it detects fundamental sequence characteristics of horizontally acquired phage DNA rather than host-specific patterns. This feature may identify unique compositional biases or k-mer distributions that distinguish prophage DNA from host chromosomes, helping detect mobile genetic elements that contribute to prokaryotic genome evolution and functional adaptation.",
