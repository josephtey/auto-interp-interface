  "reasoning": "I examined each image for patterns in feature activation, focusing on where activation signals appear in relation to genome annotations. I noted several consistent patterns: most activations show continuous strong signals across large regions of the genome rather than at specific gene loci, with clear boundaries where activation starts and stops. The activation often spans multiple genes without specificity to gene function, suggesting it's detecting broader genomic properties.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates across large continuous regions (several kb) with relatively sharp transitions between active and inactive regions. These regions contain diverse gene types with no apparent functional relationship. Activation patterns exhibit similar signal strength across bacterial and archaeal genomes, showing no taxonomic specificity. The most striking observation is that the feature appears to detect GC-rich regions, as activation typically drops sharply at genomic boundaries where compositional properties change.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect a fundamental sequence composition property (likely GC content) rather than specific gene families or functional elements.",

  "description": "This feature detects regions of high GC content in prokaryotic genomes, characterized by continuous activation across multi-gene segments. The feature shows sharp transitions at composition boundaries rather than at specific gene boundaries. It functions across diverse prokaryotes (both bacteria and archaea) without taxonomic specificity. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with activation strength proportional to the GC richness of the region. This likely represents an important compositional property that influences codon usage, DNA stability, and potentially horizontal gene transfer regions in prokaryotic genomes.",
