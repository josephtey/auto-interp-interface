  "reasoning": "I analyzed 10 examples of genomic regions where this feature shows strong activation. For each, I examined the precise location and pattern of activation peaks relative to gene annotations, looking for consistent relationships. I noticed that most activation peaks were concentrated in specific regions rather than broadly distributed, suggesting this feature detects a specific genomic element rather than a general property. I paid particular attention to the genes adjacent to activation peaks, their functional categories, and relative positions.",
  "findings": "Across examples, the feature consistently shows strong, localized activation peaks that don't correlate with a specific gene function but instead appear to detect a sequence-level pattern. The activation peaks appear predominantly in high G+C Gram-positive bacteria (Actinobacteria), including Raineyella, Pseudarthrobacter, Thermobifida, Nocardiopsis, Mycolicibacterium, and Amycolatopsis. The feature doesn't consistently activate near any particular gene type or family. The peak strength (4-6 units) and width (concentrated over ~500-1000bp) is consistent across examples, suggesting detection of a specific sequence motif or structural element common in these high G+C genomes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect a specific sequence motif or structural element common in high G+C Gram-positive bacterial genomes rather than a specific gene or functional element.",

  "description": "This feature detects what appears to be a specific sequence motif or structural element predominantly found in high G+C Gram-positive bacteria (Actinobacteria). The feature shows consistent, strong, localized activation peaks (4-6 units) spanning approximately 500-1000bp regions. These peaks don't correlate with specific gene functions or families but rather appear to detect a sequence-level pattern that may be characteristic of the high G+C content in these genomes. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with similar peak heights and widths, suggesting the detection of a conserved sequence or structural element rather than functional genomic regions. The feature is most active in Actinobacterial genomes including Raineyella, Pseudarthrobacter, Thermobifida, Nocardiopsis, Mycolicibacterium, and Amycolatopsis, suggesting taxonomic specificity in its detection pattern.",
