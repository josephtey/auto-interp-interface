{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across the provided genomic examples, focusing on when and where the feature shows strong activation. I looked for common elements, spatial relationships to annotations, and consistent patterns across different genomes.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates near or overlapping with transcriptional regulators, particularly those containing helix-turn-helix (HTH) domains and specifically XRE family transcriptional regulators. In multiple examples (sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8), the activation peaks occur precisely at or very near XRE family or HTH domain-containing regulatory proteins. The feature shows strong, localized activation patterns that correlate with these regulatory elements across diverse bacterial genomes, primarily in high G+C Gram-positive bacteria (Actinobacteria).",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with XRE family transcriptional regulators.",
  "title": "XRE family transcriptional regulator detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects XRE (Xenobiotic Response Element) family transcriptional regulators and other helix-turn-helix domain-containing proteins. The activation consistently occurs at or immediately adjacent to these regulatory proteins. The XRE family includes transcriptional regulators involved in stress response, mobile genetic element control, and various metabolic functions. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from different bacterial genomes, showing precise, localized activation. The feature appears most active in high G+C Gram-positive bacteria (Actinobacteria), including Mycolicibacterium, Nocardiopsis, Pseudarthrobacter, and related genera, suggesting potential taxonomic specificity or bias toward these bacterial groups.",
