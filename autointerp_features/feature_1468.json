  "reasoning": "I examined each image for activation patterns and their relationship to genomic annotations. I noticed strong spike activations occurring consistently at the 3' end of specific genes or at transition points between genes. The feature primarily activates at or near tRNA-related genes or genes involved in RNA processing/binding.",
  "findings": "The feature shows highly specific activation at the 3' end of genes involved in tRNA modification (mnmE, mnmG), RNA chaperones (hfq), RNA binding proteins (jag), and RNA polymerase components (rpoZ). In cases where tRNAs are present (trnL in examples 3 and 6), the feature activates precisely at these locations. The strongest activations appear at gene boundaries or termination regions of RNA-processing genes across diverse bacterial phyla.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects RNA-processing gene termini or tRNA genes across bacterial genomes, suggesting a biologically meaningful pattern related to RNA metabolism regulatory elements.",
  "title": "tRNA gene/RNA processor gene termini detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects the 3' termini of genes involved in RNA metabolism (particularly tRNA processing enzymes) and tRNA genes themselves. The feature activates with sharp spikes at these gene boundaries, suggesting recognition of termination sequences or structural elements associated with RNA processing genes. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla including proteobacteria (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 classes), firmicutes, and others, indicating a conserved genomic signature at these functional regions. The feature may be detecting transcriptional terminators, RNA secondary structures, or specific sequence motifs that mark the end of genes involved in the bacterial RNA processing machinery, representing a fundamental aspect of bacterial gene expression regulation.",
