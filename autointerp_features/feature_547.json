  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I observed strong, distinct activation peaks consistently occurring near specific genomic elements. I paid particular attention to the genomic context surrounding these peaks, noting recurring elements and their functional relationships.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation peaks near or at tRNA genes. In examples where tRNAs are present (sections 2, 5, 7), the activation peaks directly coincide with tRNA locations. The most prominent activation is seen at tRNA-Phe(gaa) in section 5, ssrA (tmRNA) in section 2, and tRNA-Thr/Trp in section 7. While not all examples contain tRNA annotations, the activation pattern is consistent with intergenic regions that may contain small RNAs. The feature appears to detect structural or sequence motifs characteristic of tRNAs or similar non-coding RNAs.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects tRNA genes and potentially other small structured non-coding RNAs across diverse prokaryotic genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and potentially other structured non-coding RNAs like tmRNA. It shows sharp, localized activation peaks precisely at the position of these elements, indicating sensitivity to the unique structural or sequence characteristics of these RNAs. When tRNAs are annotated (as in sections 2, 5, and 7), the correlation is unmistakable. The feature works consistently across diverse prokaryotes including both bacteria and archaea, suggesting it captures fundamental structural properties of these essential non-coding RNAs. The biological function relates to translation machinery components, which are critical for protein synthesis across all domains of life.",
