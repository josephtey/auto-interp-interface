  "reasoning": "I analyzed activation patterns across 10 genomic regions from different bacterial and archaeal species. I carefully examined each activation pattern's distribution, density, and relationship to annotated genes. I noticed that strong, continuous activations consistently appear within large protein-coding sequences, particularly those with repetitive or structurally complex domains.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates across the entire length of large proteins, especially those with repetitive domains or adhesion-related functions. Key examples include: PPE domain proteins in Mycobacterium (section_3), autotransporter domains (section_4), filamentous hemagglutinin/TPS domains (section_1), T1SS secreted agglutinins (section_9), and several large hypothetical proteins. The activation pattern shows continuous series of spikes throughout these genes with remarkably consistent intensity.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects large, repetitive domain-containing proteins across diverse prokaryotes, particularly those involved in adhesion or structural functions.",
  "title": "Large Repetitive Domain Protein Detector",

  "description": "This feature detects large proteins containing repetitive structural domains, particularly those involved in cellular adhesion, surface interactions, or structural functions. The activation consistently spans the entire length of these genes with repeated spike patterns reflecting the repetitive nature of their sequences. Examples include autotransporters, adhesins, PPE family proteins, and large hypothetical proteins. The feature shows particular sensitivity to proteins with structural repeats that likely form extended architectures. It activates across diverse prokaryotic taxa including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with particularly strong signals in actinobacteria. The consistent activation pattern across taxonomically diverse organisms suggests the feature is detecting fundamental sequence patterns associated with protein domain repetition rather than organism-specific sequences.",
