  "reasoning": "I analyzed the 10 genomic examples by examining the activation patterns and their relationship to gene annotations. Each example shows a pattern of regularly spaced, discrete activation spikes (typically 4-6 units high) throughout coding regions. I noted that these activations occur across diverse gene types, including metabolic enzymes, transporters, regulators, and hypothetical proteins, without apparent functional specificity. The pattern is consistently present within coding sequences (CDS) rather than intergenic regions, and maintains similar spacing regardless of the specific gene function.",
  "findings": "The feature activates with remarkable consistency within protein-coding genes across different genomes and functional categories. The spacing between activation spikes appears regular (approximately 3 bases apart in many cases), suggesting detection of a fundamental coding sequence pattern rather than gene function. Most examples show similar amplitude spikes throughout the coding regions, with no preference for gene start/end sites. The pattern is preserved across diverse bacterial genes including metabolic enzymes (Acyl-CoA oxidase, citE), transporters (eamA, ammonium transporter), regulatory proteins (transcriptional regulators), and hypothetical proteins.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects a fundamental structural pattern within protein-coding sequences across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature consistently activates throughout protein-coding sequences (CDS) with regularly-spaced spikes of similar amplitude. It appears to detect a fundamental pattern in the coding structure of genes, likely related to codon usage or other coding sequence signatures, rather than specific gene functions or families. The feature shows no preference for particular gene types, activating across diverse functional categories including metabolic enzymes, transporters, transcriptional regulators, and hypothetical proteins. The regular spacing of activation spikes (approximately every 3 bases in many examples) suggests the feature may be detecting codon-level patterns in bacterial coding sequences. This pattern is highly consistent across all examples, indicating the feature has learned to recognize a universal signature of protein-coding regions in bacterial genomes.",
