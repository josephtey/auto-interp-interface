{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, noting where peaks occurred in relation to annotated genomic elements. I tracked recurring patterns of activation near specific gene types and identified consistent positioning relative to these elements. I paid special attention to the highest activation peaks and their genomic context.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation in regions containing transposase genes (particularly IS110 family transposases) across multiple bacterial species. In examples 5, 6, and 8, the strongest activation peaks directly correspond to IS110 family transposase annotations. Other transposase types (IS3, IS5, IS701-like) also show activation but with less consistency. The activation pattern typically shows sharp peaks within or at the boundaries of transposase genes rather than extending throughout their length.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects IS110 family transposases and related mobile genetic elements across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects IS110 family transposases and related insertion sequence elements in bacterial genomes. The activation shows characteristic sharp spikes that appear directly within or at the boundaries of these mobile genetic elements. The strongest and most consistent activation occurs with IS110 family transposases, though other transposase families (IS3, IS5) sometimes trigger weaker responses. This feature likely captures sequence characteristics specific to insertion sequences that facilitate genomic mobility. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa including proteobacteria and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting the feature detects a conserved aspect of these mobile genetic elements.",
