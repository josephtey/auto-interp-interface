{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across genome examples to identify common patterns. I observed that strong feature activations consistently appeared in specific genetic contexts, focusing on the spatial relationship between activation peaks and annotated genomic elements.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, the feature consistently shows high activation at regions containing CRISPR-associated proteins and CRISPR arrays. In examples 0, 2, and 9, strong activation occurs at or near CRISPR-associated proteins (Cmr5, Cmr6, Cmr4) or CRISPR arrays. In example 9, activation occurs directly at CRISPR array boundaries. The pattern appears to be capturing CRISPR-Cas system components, particularly type III-B CRISPR modules. The activation is particularly strong at the junctions between CRISPR repeats and spacers or near CRISPR-associated genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures type III-B CRISPR-Cas systems and associated genetic elements across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects components of type III-B CRISPR-Cas systems, particularly activating at CRISPR array boundaries and CRISPR-associated genes like Cmr4, Cmr5, and Cmr6. The feature shows consistent activation patterns at the transition points between CRISPR repeats and spacers, suggesting it may recognize specific sequence motifs at these boundaries. Functionally, these elements constitute bacterial adaptive immune systems that provide defense against foreign genetic elements. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla including Chloracidobacterium, Mesomycoplasma, and Mesotoga, indicating it detects a conserved feature of these systems despite taxonomic diversity.",
