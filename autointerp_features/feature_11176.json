  "reasoning": "I analyzed the patterns of feature activation across the provided genomic examples, paying close attention to where the sharp activation spikes occur in relation to specific genomic elements. In each case, I observed clear, discrete activation peaks consistently appearing in proximity to specific genes. By comparing the annotations across all examples, I identified that activation consistently occurs near tRNA genes or specific non-coding RNA regions.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently shows sharp, discrete activation spikes that correspond to the presence of RNA elements, particularly tRNAs, or the boundaries between specific genes. In example 6, the activation peak appears near a tRNA-Pro gene. In other examples, the peaks occur at what appear to be boundaries between gene clusters or at non-coding RNA regions. The pattern is strikingly consistent across diverse bacterial genomes, suggesting the feature detects a conserved RNA structural or sequence motif.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with non-coding RNA structures or tRNA genes across bacterial genomes.",
  "title": "tRNA/ncRNA structural motif detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects specific RNA structural motifs, particularly in tRNA genes or other non-coding RNA elements. The activation consistently appears as discrete, sharp spikes at precise positions corresponding to these RNA elements. The feature shows high specificity for these elements across diverse bacterial genomes including both gram-positive and gram-negative species, suggesting it detects a highly conserved RNA structural feature. The detected motif likely represents an important functional element in bacterial RNA processing or gene expression regulation. The consistency of the pattern indicates this is a fundamental genomic element conserved through bacterial evolution.",
