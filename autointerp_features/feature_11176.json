  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify precise locations of feature activations relative to genomic annotations. I noted that in all examples, the feature shows strong, sharp spike activations at specific locations. These spikes consistently appear at positions that correspond to or are near tRNA genes or RNA-related elements. In example 4, there's a clear activation near rrl (23S ribosomal RNA). In example 8, activation occurs near trnL (tRNA-Leu). In example 2, a spike is near a CRISPR spacer region. The pattern suggests this feature detects specific RNA-related structural or sequence motifs.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at or near non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs, rRNAs, and CRISPR-related sequences. The activation pattern is characterized by sharp, discrete spikes rather than broad regions of activation. This suggests recognition of specific sequence motifs or structural elements common to these RNA features. The activation appears independent of surrounding protein-coding genes, focusing specifically on RNA elements that may share common structural or sequence characteristics across different bacterial genomes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and structural RNAs.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects structural elements common to non-coding RNAs, particularly tRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. The feature activates with sharp, high-amplitude spikes precisely at locations containing these RNA elements. The consistent pattern across diverse genomic contexts suggests the feature recognizes a conserved structural motif or sequence element essential to RNA functionality, possibly related to RNA folding, processing, or regulatory interactions. This detection appears highly specific and consistent across the examples, indicating a fundamental biological pattern rather than random associations.",
