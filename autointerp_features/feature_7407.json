  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across multiple genomic regions, focusing on where sharp peaks occur in relation to gene annotations. I analyzed the genomic context around these peaks, looking for consistent patterns in gene function, position, or sequence characteristics.",
  "findings": "Each image shows discrete, sharp activation spikes at specific genomic positions. The feature consistently activates at intergenic regions between divergently oriented genes. In multiple examples, these regions contain regulatory elements that serve as binding sites for transcription factors. These activation sites are particularly common between genes encoding metabolic functions, stress responses, and transporters in Firmicutes bacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely detects promoter/regulatory regions at divergent gene junctions that are common in Firmicutes bacteria.",

  "description": "This feature detects intergenic regions between divergently transcribed genes in Firmicutes bacteria. It specifically identifies promoter/regulatory elements where transcription occurs in opposite directions from a shared region. These regions likely contain binding sites for transcription factors and RNA polymerase. The pattern is highly consistent across examples with sharp, localized activation spikes precisely at these junctions. This feature is most active in Firmicutes genera like Desulforamulus, Methylomusa, and Kroppenstedtia, suggesting it may detect a promoter architecture or regulatory motif specific to this phylum. These divergent promoter regions are biologically significant as they allow efficient co-regulation of functionally related genes from a compact regulatory region.",
