  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genome annotations. I observed that activations consistently occur at precise positions within specific gene types, noting the strength and context of each spike. Comparing across examples, I found a strong pattern relating to prokaryotic ATP synthase/ATPase components, particularly those involved in membrane transport and ion flux.",
  "findings": "The feature shows sharp activation spikes at specific locations within genes encoding components of ATP synthase/ATPase complexes and related membrane transport proteins. Particularly evident in examples showing V-type ATPase components (section_6), cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase components (section_3), and ABC transporters (sections 2, 5, 9). The feature consistently fires in regions encoding the proton-conducting or ion-transporting portions of these complexes, suggesting detection of sequence motifs related to membrane-embedded ion channels.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects sequence patterns in genes encoding membrane-embedded components of ion-translocating protein complexes across diverse bacterial species.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif within genes encoding membrane-embedded components of prokaryotic ATP synthases, ATPases, and related ion-transporting complexes. It activates strongly at positions encoding transmembrane regions of proteins involved in proton or ion translocation across membranes. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial species (\u03b1-proteobacteria like Roseicyclus elongatus, firmicutes, actinobacteria), suggesting it captures a conserved sequence element critical for ion channel function. The feature likely recognizes amino acid motifs that form the ion-conducting pores or ion-binding sites within these membrane proteins, elements essential for energy conversion processes in bacterial cells.",
