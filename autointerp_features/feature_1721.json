  "reasoning": "I examined each image for activation patterns in relation to genomic features. I focused on identifying consistent relationships between feature activation and specific genes or regulatory elements across all examples. In each case, the feature shows sharp activation spikes at specific genomic locations.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp activation at or near tRNA genes in multiple examples. In section_0, it activates near trnV (tRNA-Val). In section_3, activation is near trnL (tRNA-Leu). In section_4, there's activation near an FMN riboswitch. In section_0, RNaseP_bact_a is also annotated nearby. The activation pattern is a consistent sharp spike that appears at specific RNA elements or their boundaries across diverse organisms from proteobacteria to archaea.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and riboswitches.",
  "title": "tRNA/ncRNA boundary detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects boundaries or structural elements of non-coding RNAs, particularly tRNAs and regulatory RNAs like riboswitches. The feature activates with sharp, distinct spikes at or near these RNA elements across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes. The consistent activation pattern suggests this feature is recognizing conserved structural or sequence elements associated with functional non-coding RNAs. This likely represents boundary regions or promoter elements of these RNA genes that are important for their transcription or processing. The pattern is highly consistent across phylogenetically diverse organisms including Shewanella species, Corynebacterium, and Methanosarcina, indicating it detects an evolutionarily conserved genomic feature.",
