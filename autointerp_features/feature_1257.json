  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I compared activation peaks across all examples, noting their position relative to gene boundaries and specific gene types. The most striking pattern is the consistent high activation peaks at or near tRNA genes or related elements.",
  "findings": "In multiple examples, the strongest feature activation occurs at or near tRNA genes or RNA-related elements. In section_0.png, a major peak appears at trnA (tRNA-Ala). In section_2.png, a T-box leader (ncRNA-region) is present, with peak activation downstream. In section_5.png, there's trnS (tRNA-Ser) with activation nearby. Several other examples show similar patterns with strong activation peaks appearing in regions that likely contain non-coding RNA elements or their processing machinery, even if not explicitly annotated as such in all cases.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects tRNA genes or related RNA regulatory elements across diverse bacterial phyla, representing a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and related non-coding RNA regulatory elements in bacterial genomes. The activation shows sharp, distinctive spikes precisely at or very near tRNA genes when annotated (as in sections 0 and 5), and at positions likely containing RNA regulatory elements in other examples. The consistent spike pattern suggests this feature recognizes sequence characteristics typical of non-coding RNA structures rather than protein-coding genes. This detection is significant as tRNAs and regulatory RNAs are critical for translation and gene regulation. The pattern appears across diverse bacterial phyla including proteobacteria, firmicutes, and cyanobacteria, indicating it captures an evolutionarily conserved RNA element signature.",
