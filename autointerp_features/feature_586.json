{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, noting their relationship to genome annotations. I observed that activations consistently occurred at or near tRNA genes, particularly with strong spikes directly at tRNA locations. When examining each example in detail, the feature shows high specificity to tRNA regardless of the surrounding genes or genomic context.",
  "findings": "The feature shows precise recognition of tRNA genes across different bacterial species. In section_1, section_5, and section_6, the activation clearly corresponds to tRNA-Phe, tRNA-Leu, and tRNA-Gly respectively. In examples without strong activations (sections 2, 3, 9), no tRNA genes are present in the visible region. The feature appears to detect a sequence or structural motif specific to tRNA genes regardless of the specific tRNA type or bacterial species.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes across bacterial genomes with high specificity and sensitivity.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes in bacterial genomes, showing strong, sharp activation spikes precisely at tRNA locations. The feature recognizes tRNAs regardless of their specific amino acid type (Phe, Leu, Gly, Val were observed). The detection appears consistent across different proteobacteria (alpha, beta, and gamma). The feature likely recognizes conserved structural elements or sequence motifs universal to bacterial tRNAs, such as the cloverleaf secondary structure or specific promoter elements. The strong, precise activation pattern suggests this feature serves as a reliable tRNA identifier that could help predict RNA gene locations in newly sequenced bacterial genomes.",
