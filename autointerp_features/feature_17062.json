  "reasoning": "I analyzed feature activation patterns across 10 bacterial genome segments, noting where strong activations occurred in relation to gene annotations. I tracked recurring patterns and identified consistent genomic contexts where the feature activates.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, consistent activation in regions containing transposase genes and insertion sequence elements across multiple bacterial genomes. Specifically, it activates for IS21-like elements (section_2), IS5 family transposase (section_1), ISAs1 family transposase (section_3), and similar mobile genetic elements. The activation often occurs within or adjacent to the transposase coding sequence, suggesting detection of sequence motifs specific to these mobile elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects bacterial insertion sequences and transposases across diverse bacterial phyla.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transposases and insertion sequence (IS) elements in bacterial genomes. The strongest activations directly correspond to IS21-like elements, IS5 family, and other transposase coding regions. The feature appears to recognize sequence motifs characteristic of mobile genetic elements, which are important for bacterial genome plasticity and horizontal gene transfer. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) and Gram-positive bacteria, indicating it captures a conserved signature of bacterial transposons. This detection capability is biologically significant as transposases are the most abundant genes in nature and play crucial roles in bacterial evolution and adaptation.",
