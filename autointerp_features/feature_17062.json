{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all 10 genomic examples, noting where high activations occurred relative to gene annotations, and looked for consistent patterns or correlations with specific gene types, positions, or genomic contexts.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation primarily in regions immediately upstream of and within the beginning portions of certain coding sequences (CDS). The activation pattern is particularly pronounced near genes involved in membrane-associated functions, transport systems, and certain metabolic pathways. Notable examples include ABC transporters, membrane proteins, cytochromes, flagellar components, and certain transcriptional regulators.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects a biologically meaningful pattern related to gene beginnings and promoter regions of membrane-associated and transport genes.",
  "title": "Membrane protein gene start/promoter detector",
  "activation-pattern": "start",
  "description": "This feature consistently detects the beginning regions of genes encoding membrane-associated proteins, transporters, and related functional categories. The activation pattern typically shows strong signals at the start of these genes and sometimes in the immediate upstream region, suggesting sensitivity to promoter elements or translation initiation sites. The feature appears to recognize sequence patterns common to genes involved in membrane processes, ion transport, and cellular interaction with the environment. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple bacterial genomes, with particularly strong activations for ABC transporters, membrane proteins, and proteins with transmembrane domains. This likely represents detection of regulatory elements or sequence motifs that are characteristic of genes involved in cellular membrane function and transport processes.",
