  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image carefully, noting feature activation patterns in relation to genomic annotations. I observed sharp, single-spike activation patterns consistently appearing near or overlapping with specific types of RNA elements across multiple examples.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, discrete activation spikes that coincide with non-coding RNA elements in bacterial genomes. Specifically, in section_5, activation peaks align with 5S ribosomal RNA (rrf); in section_0, with transfer-messenger RNA (ssrA); in section_4, with tRNA-Arg (trnR); and in section_1, with bacterial small signal recognition particle RNA (Bacteria_small_SRP). The activation pattern is consistently a sharp, high-amplitude spike precisely at these RNA elements, regardless of neighboring protein-coding genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures the presence of functional non-coding RNA elements across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects functional non-coding RNA elements in bacterial genomes, including ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), and signal recognition particle RNA (SRP RNA). The feature produces sharp, high-amplitude activation spikes precisely at the genomic location of these RNA elements, regardless of the surrounding coding sequences. These non-coding RNAs are essential for fundamental cellular processes including protein synthesis, protein targeting, and quality control. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with no significant activation for protein-coding sequences, suggesting the feature has learned to identify sequence characteristics unique to functional non-coding RNAs.",
