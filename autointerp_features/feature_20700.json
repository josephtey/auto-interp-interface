  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation pattern across multiple genomes, focusing on positions where high activations occur and their relationships to specific genomic annotations. I noted spike patterns rather than continuous activation, suggesting the feature detects specific sequence motifs rather than extended regions. The feature activations consistently appear at or near specific gene boundaries or intergenic regions, often between functionally related genes.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong activation primarily in Pedobacter aquae and other CFB group bacteria, with discrete spikes often occurring at the junctions between genes or within intergenic regions. Many activations occur near transporter proteins, secretion system components, and membrane-associated proteins. In several examples, the feature activates near type IX secretion system components (PorP/SprF family), outer membrane proteins (OmpA), or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The consistent positioning suggests it may recognize a specific sequence motif related to transcriptional regulation or gene boundaries in these bacterial systems.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with bacterial membrane transport/secretion gene boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif likely associated with gene boundaries or intergenic regions near bacterial transport and secretion systems. The feature consistently shows sharp spike activations at the junctions between genes, particularly those encoding membrane transport proteins (ABC transporters), secretion system components (especially Type IX secretion system), and outer membrane proteins. The pattern is most prevalent in Pedobacter aquae and other CFB group bacteria, suggesting taxonomic specificity. The motif may represent a promoter element, terminator, or other regulatory sequence controlling the expression of these functionally related transport/secretion genes. The consistent spike-like activation pattern and specific genomic context suggest this represents a genuine biological signal rather than a random pattern.",
