  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation and their relationship to genomic annotations. I looked for recurring elements across examples, noting the strength and position of activation peaks relative to specific genes or genomic features. I particularly focused on elements that consistently appeared near or at activation sites across multiple examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation peaks in proximity to CRISPR-associated elements in several examples. In section_3, the peak activation coincides with ID 10 (CRISPR repeat). Similarly, in section_8, activation occurs near IDs 4-6 (CRISPR spacer and repeats). In section_4, activation appears near ID 12 (CRISPR spacer). When CRISPR elements are not present, activation often coincides with tRNA genes (section_4, IDs 3/11) or genes involved in DNA/RNA processing. The activation pattern typically presents as a sharp peak with strong signal intensity, suggesting specificity for these elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects CRISPR-associated elements and related nucleic acid structures, representing a biologically meaningful genomic pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR-associated elements, particularly CRISPR repeats and spacers, as well as structurally similar nucleic acid elements like tRNAs. The feature activates directly at or adjacent to these elements, showing strong, localized peaks. This suggests a role in detecting repetitive DNA structures that are important for bacterial adaptive immunity. The pattern is highly consistent across examples containing CRISPR elements, with the feature showing its strongest activation precisely at these locations. In examples without CRISPR elements, activation still occurs at structurally similar regions, suggesting the feature may be detecting a conserved structural motif common to these elements.",
