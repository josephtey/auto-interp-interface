  "reasoning": "I examined each example by identifying the location of strong activation peaks and their relation to nearby annotations. I noted that the feature consistently shows high activation in regions containing DNA-binding transcriptional regulators (particularly HTH or XRE-family), often positioned at genomic boundaries between functional elements. The peak patterns often overlap with or are adjacent to genes encoding regulatory proteins. Multiple examples show this feature firing near mobile genetic element boundaries.",
  "findings": "Across examples, the feature shows strong (5-8 value) activation peaks near genes encoding helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain-containing proteins, XRE-family transcriptional regulators, or other DNA-binding regulatory elements. These regions frequently occur at junctions between different genomic elements like phage genes, mobile genetic elements, or specialized gene clusters. The feature is particularly active at genome positions containing transcriptional regulators that control horizontal gene transfer, conjugation systems, phage integration, or other mobile genetic elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently captures genomic regions containing transcriptional regulatory elements at mobile genetic element boundaries across diverse bacterial species.",

  "description": "This feature detects regions containing transcriptional regulatory proteins, particularly those with helix-turn-helix (HTH) or XRE-family domains. The feature activates precisely at the location of these regulatory genes, which are frequently positioned at the boundaries of mobile genetic elements (phage genes, conjugation systems, integrons). The biological function appears to be identification of control points for horizontal gene transfer and mobile element expression. The pattern is highly consistent across the examples, appearing in diverse bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria), suggesting this is a fundamental pattern in bacterial genome organization related to transcriptional control of mobile genetic elements.",
