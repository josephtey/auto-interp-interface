  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify the genomic context where the feature activates strongly. I noted activation patterns relative to gene annotations, looking for consistency across examples. In all cases, activation occurs across extended regions rather than discrete points, often spanning multiple genes. The feature appears to detect something common to enterobacteria, as all examples come from this family.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation across regions containing multiple coding sequences in enterobacteria genomes. The activation is not limited to specific gene types but appears to correlate with regions having high gene density. The pattern transitions from low to high activation and sometimes shows an irregular pattern within the activation region. The strongest signal appears in regions with multiple, consecutive coding sequences, suggesting the feature might be detecting properties of gene-dense regions in bacterial genomes rather than specific genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect gene-dense regions in enterobacterial genomes, possibly capturing properties of coding DNA.",

  "description": "This feature detects regions of high gene density in enterobacterial genomes. It activates across extended segments containing multiple coding sequences, suggesting it recognizes properties common to coding regions rather than specific genes. The activation shows a pattern of ramping up at the beginning of gene-dense regions and maintaining high activation across multiple consecutive genes. The feature is particularly active in Yersinia, Klebsiella, and other enterobacteria. This pattern is highly consistent across examples, showing similar activation profiles across different genomes when multiple genes are present in close proximity. The feature likely captures fundamental properties of bacterial coding DNA that distinguish it from non-coding regions, potentially related to codon usage patterns or other sequence characteristics common to coding regions in enterobacteria.",
