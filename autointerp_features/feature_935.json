  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation related to genomic elements. The feature consistently shows strong activation across continuous regions containing bacterial secretion system genes - particularly Type II, Type VI, and related secretion machinery. The activation is not isolated to a single gene but spans operons containing multiple secretion system components.",
  "findings": "The feature strongly activates across operons encoding bacterial secretion systems, especially in enterobacteria (Yersinia, Klebsiella, Serratia, Cronobacter, Mixta). It captures Type II secretion system genes (gspE, gspF, gspG, gspJ, gspK, gspL), Type VI secretion system components (tssC, tssF, icmF), pilus assembly proteins (cpaE, cpaF), and tight adherence operons. The activation consistently spans multiple adjacent genes involved in these macromolecular transport systems, suggesting recognition of the broader secretion machinery genomic context rather than individual genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures bacterial secretion system operons, representing a biologically meaningful pattern important for bacterial protein transport.",

  "description": "This feature detects operons encoding bacterial protein secretion systems, primarily recognizing Type II and Type VI secretion machinery in enterobacteria. The feature activates continuously across entire operons containing multiple secretion system components, suggesting it captures the genomic context of these macromolecular transport complexes rather than individual genes. It identifies both structural components (like gspG pseudopilins) and energetic machinery (like gspE ATPases). The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with strongest signal in regions containing clusters of 4+ secretion-related genes. This represents a biologically significant pattern as secretion systems are critical virulence determinants in many pathogenic enterobacteria.",
