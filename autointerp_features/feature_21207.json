  "reasoning": "I examined each of the 10 images showing feature activation patterns across genomic regions, focusing on the precise position of activation spikes relative to genomic annotations. I looked for consistent patterns in the positioning and genomic context of these activation events, identifying which genomic elements were consistently present at or near activation sites.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, localized activation (sharp spikes) at or near tRNA genes in multiple examples. In section_2, the activation spike aligns with tRNA-Leu (ID 10). In section_5, there's a marked spike near tRNA-Glu (ID 4). In sections_0, _4, and _8, I observed similar activation patterns that appear in regions where non-coding RNAs are present. The feature activates at precise positions with consistent genomic context patterns, suggesting it's detecting a specific RNA structural or sequence motif rather than protein-coding genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes and potentially other structured non-coding RNAs, capturing a biologically meaningful pattern associated with RNA secondary structure.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and possibly other structured non-coding RNAs across bacterial genomes. The activation pattern shows sharp, localized spikes directly at or adjacent to annotated tRNAs (as seen in sections 2 and 5 with tRNA-Leu and tRNA-Glu). The consistent activation pattern suggests the feature is recognizing a conserved structural motif characteristic of tRNAs, which form distinct cloverleaf secondary structures. This likely relates to the biological function of tRNAs in translation, where their highly conserved structure is essential for proper amino acid loading and ribosomal interaction. The pattern is highly consistent across examples where tRNAs are present, with activation specifically occurring at the precise genomic position of these non-coding RNA elements.",
