  "reasoning": "I analyzed each activation pattern carefully, noting where the feature activates strongly across the genomic regions. I looked for consistent patterns of activation in relation to specific genes, gene families, or genomic elements. I noted that in almost all examples, the activation shows as sharp, discrete spikes rather than broad regions, and these spikes often appear near or at transposable elements or their associated components.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, the feature shows strong activation associated with transposable elements and related genes. In section_3, activation occurs near an IS1380 family transposase. In section_5, activation is near IS3 family transposase and InsE transposase. In section_7, activation appears near a cluster of transposases including IS630 and IS66 family transposases. In section_8, a strong activation peak appears near an integrase domain-containing protein. This consistent pattern suggests the feature is detecting a sequence motif or structural element common to transposable elements across diverse bacterial species.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects sequences associated with bacterial transposases and insertion sequences across multiple bacterial phyla.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects sequence patterns associated with bacterial transposable elements, particularly near various transposase genes (IS3, IS1380, IS66, IS630 families) and their associated components. The feature activation shows as sharp, discrete spikes precisely at or near these elements across diverse bacterial species, including proteobacteria (alpha, beta, gamma), firmicutes, and others. The consistent activation pattern suggests this feature is capturing a conserved sequence motif or structural element common to prokaryotic mobile genetic elements. This detection capability likely represents recognition of insertion sequences that play important roles in bacterial genome plasticity, horizontal gene transfer, and evolution. The pattern is highly consistent across taxonomically diverse bacterial genomes, indicating a widely conserved feature of transposable elements.",
