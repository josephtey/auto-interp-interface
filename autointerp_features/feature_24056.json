  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, noting their relationship to the genome annotations. All images show activation along the gene bodies with a characteristic pattern of dense, evenly-spaced, short vertical spikes of moderate to high intensity. The activations consistently appear within protein-coding sequences (CDS) rather than in intergenic regions, suggesting this feature detects something common to coding sequences in this organism.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation within protein-coding genes of Pararhodospirillum photometricum, an \u03b1-proteobacterium. The activation pattern is characterized by regular, dense spike patterns that span gene bodies but abruptly terminate at gene boundaries. No specific gene family appears to be targeted; activations appear across diverse functional gene categories including metabolic enzymes, transporters, regulatory proteins, and structural components. The consistent spacing of activation spikes suggests the feature may be detecting a common sequence composition or codon usage pattern characteristic of this organism's coding regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a fundamental property of protein-coding sequences in Pararhodospirillum photometricum.",

  "description": "This feature detects protein-coding sequences (CDS regions) in Pararhodospirillum photometricum. The activation consistently spans entire gene bodies with characteristic dense, evenly-spaced spike patterns that begin and end precisely at gene boundaries. The feature appears agnostic to gene function, activating across diverse functional categories including metabolism, transport, regulation, and cellular structure. This suggests the feature is capturing fundamental properties of coding sequences such as codon usage bias, GC content, or other sequence composition features specific to this organism. The pattern is highly consistent across all examples, with clear demarcation between coding and non-coding regions. This feature appears to be specific to P. photometricum genomic coding sequences and may be useful for gene prediction or taxonomic classification.",
