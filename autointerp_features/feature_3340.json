  "reasoning": "I analyzed 10 images showing activation patterns of a genomic feature, examining where the feature activates in relation to gene annotations. I looked for consistent patterns in activation location, strength, and genomic context. The feature consistently shows sharp, strong spike activations (amplitude ~2-3) at specific locations that appear to coincide with small heat shock proteins or related genes in multiple bacterial species.",
  "findings": "The feature shows consistent strong activation at or near genes involved in heat shock response, particularly small heat shock proteins of the HSP20 family and related stress response elements. In examples where heat shock genes are clearly annotated (section_9 contains ibpA, shsP, and multiple heat resistance proteins; section_8 shows ibpA near the activation spike), the feature shows strong activation. In other examples, the activation appears near genes potentially involved in stress response (e.g., response regulators, proteases like FtsH). This suggests the feature detects a specific sequence motif or structural element common to heat shock protein genes across diverse bacterial phyla.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with bacterial heat shock response genes, particularly those of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family.",

  "description": "This feature detects genomic regions containing small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) of the HSP20 family and related heat stress response elements. The feature consistently shows sharp spike activations directly at or very near these genes across diverse bacterial phyla. In section_9, the feature activates near multiple annotated heat shock proteins including shsP (small heat shock protein sHSP20-GI). In section_8, activation occurs near ibpA (Small heat shock protein IbpA, HSP20 family). Additional activations occur near other stress response elements like the ATP-dependent protease FtsH and heat resistance proteins in various bacterial species. This suggests the feature recognizes a conserved sequence motif or regulatory element common to heat shock response genes, likely representing a critical functional element for bacterial stress adaptation. The pattern is consistent across proteobacteria, firmicutes, and other bacterial phyla.",
