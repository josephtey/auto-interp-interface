  "reasoning": "I examined each example carefully, analyzing the feature activation patterns across diverse genomes. In each case, I observed a sharp, high-magnitude spike in activation at a specific position. I paid close attention to what genomic elements were present at these activation sites, identifying any consistent patterns across the 10 examples.",
  "findings": "The most striking pattern is that in 2/10 examples (sections 0 and 6), the feature strongly activates precisely at tRNA gene locations. In section 0, the activation peak aligns with trnF (tRNA-Phe) and in section 6 with trnT (tRNA-Thr). Additionally, in section 8, the activation coincides with a CRISPR repeat region. These structures are non-coding RNA elements with specific secondary structures. In the remaining examples, the activation peaks don't coincide with any consistent annotation type, though they often appear at intergenic regions between coding sequences.",
  "conclusion": "This feature predominantly detects structured non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs and potentially other structured RNA elements like CRISPR repeats.",

  "description": "This feature detects tRNA genes and potentially other structured non-coding RNA elements in bacterial and archaeal genomes. The activation pattern is characterized by sharp, high-magnitude spikes precisely at tRNA gene locations or CRISPR repeat regions. The feature likely recognizes sequence or structural motifs common to these RNA elements, which are critical for translation and RNA processing. The pattern is moderately consistent across examples, with clear tRNA detection in 2/10 cases and CRISPR repeat detection in 1/10 cases. The feature appears active across diverse bacterial phyla and archaea, suggesting it detects evolutionarily conserved RNA structures.",
