{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify when and where the feature activates, looking for patterns in gene context. I noticed the feature consistently fires strongly near ABC transporters and transport-related proteins across different bacterial species. The activation pattern is typically a sharp spike occurring near or within genes annotated as ABC transporter components (ATP-binding proteins, permeases, substrate-binding proteins).",
  "findings": "In most examples, the feature activates strongly in proximity to ABC transporter components. Examples include: branched-chain amino acid transport system in Geovibrio (example 1), ABC transporter components in Limnochorda (example 2), peptide/ABC transporters in Desulfosarcina (example 3), tonB-dependent receptor/transport in Phocaeicola (example 4), and ABC transporter ATP-binding proteins in Gemmatimonas (example 6). The activation pattern is consistently a sharp spike, suggesting the feature detects a specific sequence motif rather than broader genomic regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects sequences associated with bacterial ABC transporter components, particularly the ATP-binding domains.",

  "description": "This feature strongly detects sequences associated with bacterial ABC transporter components, particularly focusing on ATP-binding domains and associated transport proteins. The feature shows sharp, high-amplitude spikes directly over or adjacent to genes annotated as ABC transporter ATP-binding proteins, permease components, or substrate-binding proteins. The feature appears to recognize conserved sequence motifs present in these transporter components, likely related to the Walker A/B motifs or other ATP-binding cassette signatures. The detection is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, suggesting it captures a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved feature of bacterial transport systems. This feature likely represents functional domains critical for ABC transporter activity, which are essential for nutrient uptake, drug efflux, and other transport functions in bacteria.",
