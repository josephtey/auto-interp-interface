  "reasoning": "I examined each example, focusing on the sharp activation peaks visible in the feature visualization. I noticed the feature consistently produces high-activation spikes at or near CRISPR repeat regions. In 5 out of 7 examples where activation is visible (sections 8, 6, 9, 2, 7), there is a labeled CRISPR repeat or spacer in close proximity to the activation spike. The remaining examples show similar sharp activation patterns but may have unlabeled CRISPR elements.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, consistent activation at CRISPR repeat regions in bacterial genomes. These activations appear as sharp, distinct spikes rather than broad activations, suggesting recognition of specific sequence motifs rather than general genomic regions. The feature consistently activates at or very near annotated CRISPR repeats (sections 8, 9, 2, 7) or spacers (section 1), with activation strength ranging from 2.0-3.5. CRISPR systems are bacterial immune mechanisms consisting of repeat sequences separated by spacers derived from foreign genetic elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures CRISPR repeat elements across bacterial genomes, representing a biologically meaningful pattern important for prokaryotic adaptive immunity.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR repeat elements in bacterial genomes. It produces sharp activation spikes precisely at or very near CRISPR repeat sequences. CRISPR repeats are conserved palindromic sequences that flank spacer sequences in CRISPR arrays, forming the structural backbone of prokaryotic adaptive immune systems. The feature's high specificity for these elements suggests it recognizes the distinctive sequence composition or secondary structure characteristics of CRISPR repeats. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with most activations directly corresponding to annotated CRISPR elements. This detection capability is biologically significant as CRISPR systems are critical for bacterial defense against foreign genetic elements like phages and plasmids.",
