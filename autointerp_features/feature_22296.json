{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify where the feature activates in relation to annotated genes. The feature consistently shows sharp spike activations at specific genomic junctions, usually between gene boundaries. This pattern appears across diverse bacterial species, suggesting a sequence-specific rather than organism-specific feature.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at intergenic regions, particularly at the boundaries between operons or gene clusters with related functions. Examples include: activation between transcriptional regulators and their target genes, between components of metabolic pathways, and at the boundaries of gene clusters that encode functionally related proteins. The spike-like activation pattern suggests recognition of a specific sequence motif rather than a broader structural element.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely detects bacterial gene boundary motifs or operon junctions, possibly related to transcriptional regulation elements.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific DNA sequences at bacterial gene boundaries, particularly at operon junctions. It activates precisely at the transition points between functionally related genes across diverse bacterial species (proteobacteria, CFB group bacteria, etc.). The exact sequence motif likely represents regulatory elements such as transcription terminators/initiators or intergenic control regions. The consistent sharp spike pattern and positioning between functionally related genes (e.g., between flagellar proteins, between metabolic enzymes, between regulatory proteins and their targets) suggests this feature captures elements involved in coordinating gene expression within operons.",
