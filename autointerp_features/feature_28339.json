  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across the provided genomic examples. I noted that in nearly all cases, the feature shows a sharp, single spike of activation (high amplitude, narrow width) at very specific genomic locations. These spikes occur near specific gene boundaries but don't necessarily correlate with particular gene families or functions. The diversity of organisms where this pattern appears (from Gram-positive bacteria to proteobacteria to archaea) suggests a sequence-specific rather than function-specific feature.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at gene boundaries, particularly at the beginning or end of genes. The activation spike is remarkably precise and narrow, suggesting detection of a specific sequence motif rather than a broader genomic element. Examples include: activation at the end of a polyketide synthase gene (section_0), between glgA and glgX genes (section_1), at NUDIX domain boundary (section_2), between hypothetical proteins (section_3), near 5S rRNA (section_4), near bamC gene (section_5), near ttcA gene (section_6), between a tRNA and rRNA genes (section_7), near the start of cobN gene (section_9). This consistent boundary-associated pattern suggests the feature detects a specific sequence signature commonly found at gene junctions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects a sequence motif likely associated with gene boundaries or potential regulatory elements across diverse prokaryotic genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects a highly specific sequence motif that frequently appears at gene boundaries across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes. The activation pattern is characterized by sharp, isolated spikes (rather than continuous activation regions), indicating recognition of a precise sequence signature rather than a broader functional element. The motif appears in various genomic contexts and across diverse bacteria (proteobacteria, Gram-positive) and archaea, suggesting it may represent a conserved sequence element involved in gene delimitation, transcription termination, or transition elements between coding regions. The consistency of the spike pattern and its positioning at gene boundaries or intergenic regions strongly indicates this feature detects a short, specific DNA sequence motif that has been evolutionarily conserved across prokaryotic domains.",
