  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully, noting the position of activation spikes relative to genomic annotations. I looked for patterns in the types of genes or elements where activations occurred, their relative positions, and the consistency of these patterns across examples. I identified common themes in the genomic context of activation sites and analyzed the biological significance of these patterns.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp, distinct activation spikes at positions that correspond to boundaries between genes, particularly at gene starts and ends. These activation sites appear to be independent of the specific gene function but are related to transition regions between coding sequences. The activations are strongest at positions where genes with different orientations or functions meet, suggesting sensitivity to sequence motifs common at gene boundaries such as promoters, terminators, or regulatory elements. The pattern is highly consistent across different bacterial genomes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to gene boundary regions in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects the transition regions between genes in bacterial genomes, particularly: - Intergenic regions where adjacent genes have different orientations - Regions containing potential regulatory elements such as promoters or terminators - Sequence motifs associated with transcription start sites or transcription termination - The feature activates sharply at these boundaries with high specificity - This likely represents detection of sequence signatures associated with gene regulation and transcriptional control - The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial genomes and gene types - This suggests the feature is capturing fundamental sequence patterns at bacterial gene boundaries rather than specific gene functions",
