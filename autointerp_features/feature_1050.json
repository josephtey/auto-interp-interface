{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify where the feature activation spikes occurred relative to genomic annotations, looking for patterns in positioning, strength, and genomic context. I compared these patterns across all examples to find consistent relationships.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, sharp activation spikes near tRNA genes or at boundaries between coding sequences. In example 3, the activation coincides with trnP (tRNA-Pro). In example 5, activation occurs near a pseudotRNA. In example 1, activation appears at locations that could mark RNA regulatory elements. The pattern appears across diverse bacterial phyla including proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, and archaea.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects tRNA genes and potential RNA-related structural elements at gene boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature detects tRNA genes and potentially other structured RNA elements. The activation consistently appears as sharp, well-defined spikes at or very near tRNA locations or at intergenic boundaries that likely contain structured RNA elements. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacteria and archaea, suggesting the feature has captured a universal structural motif common to tRNA and certain regulatory RNA elements. The feature may be recognizing specific base-pairing patterns or secondary structure characteristics fundamental to RNA function across taxonomic boundaries.",
