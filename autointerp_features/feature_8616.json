  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I observed a consistent relationship between high activation peaks and ABC transporter genes, particularly the ATPase components, across diverse organisms.",
  "findings": "In 8 of 10 examples, the feature strongly activates on or near ABC transporter ATPase components (e.g., ccmA, ABC-type multidrug transport ATPase). The pattern is highly specific to the ATP-binding components rather than the permease components of these systems. The activation is consistent across phylogenetically diverse organisms including proteobacteria, firmicutes, and archaea.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly identifies ABC transporter ATPase components across diverse organisms, suggesting it captures a conserved sequence motif related to ATP binding.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects ABC transporter ATP-binding components across diverse organisms. It consistently shows strong activation over genes annotated as ABC-type transport system ATPase components (especially ccmA/multidrug transport ATPases). The feature likely recognizes a conserved nucleotide sequence encoding the Walker A/B motifs or other ATP-binding cassette characteristic of these transporters. The pattern is remarkably consistent across phylogenetically distant organisms (bacteria and archaea), highlighting the evolutionary conservation of these essential components. The specificity to the ATP-binding rather than transmembrane components suggests the feature captures sequence elements unique to the nucleotide-binding domain structure.",
