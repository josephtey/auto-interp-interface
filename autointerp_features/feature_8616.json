  "reasoning": "I examined each example to identify the genomic feature associated with the activation pattern. In all examples, the feature shows strong, specific activation directly at or overlapping with tRNA genes. The pattern appears highly specific to tRNA across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at tRNA genes regardless of the specific tRNA type (tRNA-Ala, tRNA-Ser, tRNA-Val). In examples 7, 2, 8, 6, and 0, the activation spike is precisely at the annotated tRNA location (IDs 6, 8, 9, 4, and 6 respectively). The feature shows no specificity for particular amino acid tRNAs but instead recognizes a common structural or sequence element in tRNAs generally. The activation pattern is discrete and localized, with sharp boundaries corresponding to tRNA gene boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes across diverse prokaryotic genomes, likely identifying conserved structural or sequence elements common to all tRNAs.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes across diverse prokaryotic genomes. The activation consistently occurs precisely at tRNA gene locations regardless of the specific tRNA type (e.g., tRNA-Ala, tRNA-Ser, tRNA-Val). The feature likely recognizes highly conserved structural elements or sequence motifs that are common to all tRNAs despite differences in their anticodons. The activation pattern shows sharp, well-defined boundaries corresponding to tRNA gene boundaries, with no activation in flanking regions. This pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse organisms including Euryarchaeota (Thermococcus, Methanocella) and various bacterial phyla, indicating the feature has identified fundamental characteristics of tRNAs that are conserved across prokaryotic domains.",
