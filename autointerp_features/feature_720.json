  "reasoning": "I analyzed the feature activation patterns across 10 different bacterial genomes, focusing on the timing, location, and strength of activations relative to genome annotations. I observed a strong pattern of high activation spikes near tRNA genes in multiple examples and identified a consistent relationship with specific types of RNA molecules.",
  "findings": "In all examples where the feature shows high activation (>3.0), the activation occurs at or near a transfer RNA (tRNA) gene or ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operon. For instance, in Nocardiopsis gilva, activation peaks near tRNA-Ser; in Vulgatibacter incomptus, near tRNA-Arg; in Treponema brennaborense, near tRNA-Val; and in Aquirhabdus parva, at tRNA-Ile/tRNA-Ala adjacent to rRNA genes. The feature appears particularly sensitive to the region immediately upstream of tRNA genes or at the junction between tRNA genes in ribosomal RNA operons.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects tRNA genes and their immediate genomic context across diverse bacterial phyla.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes across bacterial genomes. It shows sharp, high-amplitude activation spikes precisely at or slightly upstream of tRNA coding regions. In several cases (sections 0, 7), the feature also activates near tRNA genes that are positioned within ribosomal RNA operons. The consistent detection across phylogenetically diverse bacteria (including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Spirochetes, and Cyanobacteria) suggests this feature is capturing a fundamental structural or sequence characteristic common to all tRNA genes, likely related to their promoter regions or the specific structural characteristics of the tRNA genes themselves. This pattern is highly consistent across all examples that contain tRNA genes, indicating this feature plays an important role in identifying these critical non-coding RNA elements involved in protein translation.",
