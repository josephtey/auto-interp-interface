  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across 10 examples, focusing on where the feature activates strongly and what genomic elements are present at those locations. I looked for recurring elements or motifs across the examples, paying attention to the strength and positioning of activations.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates near genes encoding bacterial surface antigens with D15 domains, membrane fusion proteins, and outer membrane proteins. In example 8, activation peaks coincide with \"Bacterial surface antigen (D15) domain-containing protein\". In example 9, activation occurs near \"fhaC: Hemolysin activation/secretion protein\". Example 2 shows strong activation near \"Bacterial surface antigen (D15) domain-containing protein\". This pattern repeats across other examples with outer membrane proteins, membrane fusion proteins, and related transport proteins.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects bacterial outer membrane proteins, particularly those containing D15 domains and related secretion/transport systems.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects bacterial outer membrane proteins, particularly those containing D15 domains, membrane fusion proteins, and related secretion/transport systems. The feature activates with strong spikes directly over or adjacent to genes encoding these proteins. These proteins are crucial for bacterial cell envelope integrity, protein secretion, and transport across membranes. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial species, suggesting this represents a conserved structural or functional motif in bacterial outer membrane proteins. The feature is particularly active in Proteobacteria like Agarivorans albus, but also appears in other bacterial phyla, indicating it captures a broadly distributed bacterial membrane protein element.",
