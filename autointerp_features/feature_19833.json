  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in the feature activation peaks and their relationship to genomic annotations. I focused on identifying common genomic elements, consistent positioning, and biological relationships across the examples.",
  "findings": "The feature shows consistent, sharp activation spikes at specific positions across different bacterial genomes. In almost all examples, the activation peaks occur at intergenic regions, specifically at the boundaries between genes. There is no consistent association with particular gene families or functions, but rather with specific genomic positions relative to gene arrangements. The feature appears to detect a sequence-specific regulatory or structural motif common in bacterial genomes across different taxonomic groups including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and CFB group bacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern that likely represents a conserved intergenic sequence motif or regulatory element.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif that consistently appears in intergenic regions of bacterial genomes. The feature activation shows sharp, isolated spikes of high intensity at precise locations between genes, suggesting it recognizes a specific DNA sequence pattern rather than gene content. The motif appears across diverse bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria (alpha and gamma), Firmicutes, and CFB group bacteria, indicating it may be a broadly conserved bacterial genome element. The consistent intergenic positioning suggests this could represent a regulatory element such as a transcription factor binding site, a promoter element, or a structural DNA motif that serves a function in genome organization. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with the feature showing no preference for specific gene functions in the flanking regions.",
