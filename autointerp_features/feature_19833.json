  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify the genomic context where the feature activates, looking for patterns in the activation peaks relative to gene annotations. I examined the strength and position of each activation spike, noted nearby genes and their functions, and compared patterns across examples to identify common elements.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates as a sharp spike near gene junctions or intergenic regions, often between coding sequences with opposite orientations or at the end of genes. In multiple examples (sections 0, 3, 5, 6, 9), the activation appears near regulatory elements or genes involved in RNA processing, transcription factors, or specialized secretion systems. The spikes frequently occur at sequence boundaries that likely represent transition points between functional genomic elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture transcriptional transition zones or regulatory boundaries in bacterial genomes, potentially identifying terminators or promoter elements.",
  "title": "Bacterial Gene Boundary Detection Feature",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects bacterial gene boundaries or regulatory transition zones, particularly at intergenic regions between divergently transcribed genes. It fires strongly at positions that likely contain transcriptional terminators, promoters, or other regulatory sequences. The feature may be identifying specific DNA structural or sequence motifs that signal the end of one transcriptional unit and the beginning of another. This pattern is highly consistent across examples, always manifesting as a sharp, well-defined activation spike at these boundary regions. The biological function represented likely involves termination of transcription, initiation of new transcriptional units, or genomic organization points that separate functional modules in bacterial genomes.",
