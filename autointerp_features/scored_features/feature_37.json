  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, focusing on correlation with genome annotations. In each image, I observed strong and specific activation peaks at distinct regions of bacterial genomes. I cross-referenced these peaks with the provided annotations, looking for consistent patterns in gene types, positioning, or functional relationships.",
  "findings": "The most striking pattern is that activation consistently occurs near ribosomal proteins or translation-related elements. In section_3, activation aligns with 16S ribosomal RNA (rrs). In section_0, activation appears near rpsD (30S ribosomal protein S4). In section_1, activation is near insQ transposase with downstream signal near 30S ribosomal protein S2 (rpsB). In other examples, activation occurs near translation machinery components or regulatory elements like transcription factors. The activation shows discrete spike patterns rather than broad regions, suggesting recognition of specific sequence motifs rather than general genomic features.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects ribosomal RNA and ribosomal protein gene regions across diverse bacterial species, suggesting a biological role in identifying translation machinery components.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects genomic regions containing ribosomal RNA genes and ribosomal protein coding sequences across diverse bacterial species. The activation occurs precisely at or near these translation-related elements, with particularly strong signal observed near 16S rRNA in section_3 and ribosomal proteins like S4 (rpsD) in section_0. The feature shows consistent activation patterns in proteobacteria (gamma, epsilon) and firmicutes, suggesting it recognizes conserved sequence characteristics of bacterial translation machinery components. This detection capability likely relates to the highly conserved nature of ribosomal genes across bacterial taxa, making them important genomic landmarks. The consistent activation pattern across phylogenetically diverse bacteria indicates this feature captures fundamental sequence signatures essential for translation processes.",
