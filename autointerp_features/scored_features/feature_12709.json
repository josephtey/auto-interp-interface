{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image looking for patterns in where the feature activates strongly in relation to genomic annotations. I observed that the activation pattern appears as continuous stretches of high spikes across specific regions of the genome. I then compared activations across all examples to identify common elements or contextual patterns.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation across regions containing primarily hypothetical proteins. There is no clear correlation with specific annotated gene functions. In examples where some genes have functional annotations (like tRNA, CRISPR elements, or enzymes), the activations don't seem to preferentially associate with these elements. The activation patterns appear in blocks or stretches that span multiple genes rather than correlating with specific gene boundaries or regulatory elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely captures a sequence composition pattern not directly tied to specific gene function.",

  "description": "This feature appears to detect regions with particular sequence composition characteristics rather than specific functional elements. The activation occurs in continuous blocks spanning multiple genes regardless of their annotation, suggesting it's capturing fundamental DNA properties like GC-content, codon bias, or specific k-mer patterns. These patterns may reflect genome-wide properties related to evolutionary history or genomic structure rather than specific gene functions. The pattern is quite consistent across examples in its presentation as continuous blocks of activation rather than gene-specific signals, though the genomic context varies widely between examples.",
