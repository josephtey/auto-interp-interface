  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples and identified the consistent genomic features associated with strong feature activations. I focused on precise locations of activation peaks, their shapes, and the neighboring genomic elements to determine what biological pattern this feature captures.",
  "findings": "In all examples, the feature shows sharp, high-amplitude activation spikes at very specific positions. These activation peaks consistently appear near transcriptional regulators, particularly at the 5' (upstream) region of regulator genes. Prominent examples include: IclR family transcriptional regulator (example 4), penicillinase repressor (example 5), cAMP-activated global transcriptional regulator CRP (example 6), TetR/AcrR family transcriptional regulator (example 2), and LacI family transcriptional regulator (example 0). The feature may be capturing regulatory elements such as promoters or transcription factor binding sites upstream of these regulator genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects transcriptional regulator promoter regions or binding sites, representing a biologically significant regulatory pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects promoter regions or regulatory binding sites associated with transcriptional regulator genes. It shows very sharp, high-amplitude activation spikes at the 5' regions of various transcriptional regulator families including LacI, IclR, TetR/AcrR, CRP, and penicillinase repressors. The feature may be identifying conserved sequence motifs in prokaryotic promoter regions that control the expression of these regulatory proteins. These elements are critical for initiating the transcription of genes that modulate various cellular processes including metabolism, stress response, and antibiotic resistance. The pattern is highly consistent across the examples, with the feature almost exclusively activating at these regulatory regions despite the diverse genomic contexts.",
