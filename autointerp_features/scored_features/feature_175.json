  "reasoning": "I examined each of the 10 examples carefully, focusing on where feature activations occurred relative to genome annotations. I noticed a consistent pattern across examples - strong activation peaks predominantly occur at tRNA genes or near tRNA genes. In examples where tRNAs are explicitly annotated (sections 1 and 6), the highest activation peaks directly correspond to tRNA locations. In other examples, high activation peaks show similarities in pattern and position that suggest they may be capturing tRNA-like structures or regions with similar sequence characteristics even where explicit tRNA annotations aren't provided. The activation pattern typically shows sharp, distinct spikes rather than broad regions of activation.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently activates at or near tRNA genes when they are annotated (trnP in example 1 and trnA in example 6). The activation pattern shows characteristic sharp spikes with high intensity (values around 4) at these locations. The surrounding genomic context varies across examples, but the feature appears to be specifically detecting sequence patterns characteristic of tRNA genes or similar non-coding RNA structures. The pattern is taxonomically consistent across different bacterial groups (firmicutes, proteobacteria, etc.), suggesting this feature captures a conserved genomic element across diverse organisms.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects tRNA genes and potentially related non-coding RNA structures across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and potentially other structured non-coding RNAs in bacterial genomes. The strongest activations occur directly at annotated tRNA locations as seen in examples with trnP (tRNA-Pro) and trnA (tRNA-Ala). Activations show as sharp, high-intensity spikes at these locations, typically reaching values around 4. The feature appears to recognize the characteristic secondary structure or sequence motifs of tRNAs, which are essential for protein translation. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa, detecting this fundamental genetic element in various genomic contexts. This suggests the feature captures evolutionarily conserved aspects of tRNA structure that are maintained across bacterial phyla.",
