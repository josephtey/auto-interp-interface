  "reasoning": "I examined the activation pattern across all examples and noticed a consistent sharp spike of high activation (amplitude 6-7.5) in each image. I looked for positional relationships between this spike and genomic features, paying attention to whether the spike corresponds to start/end of genes, intergenic regions, or specific genetic elements.",
  "findings": "The activation spike consistently appears at what appears to be an intergenic region or boundary between genetic elements. It doesn't correlate with any specific gene family across examples but rather seems to represent a structural or regulatory feature present at gene boundaries. The spike is sharp and localized, suggesting a specific sequence motif or structural element rather than gene content. Across diverse organisms (firmicutes, proteobacteria, CFB group bacteria), this pattern appears consistently.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to gene boundaries or regulatory regions that appears conserved across diverse bacterial taxa.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif or structural element that appears at gene boundaries or intergenic regions in bacterial genomes. The feature activates with a sharp, high-amplitude spike at these locations, which likely represent conserved regulatory elements such as promoters, terminators, or other DNA structural motifs that affect DNA packaging or gene expression. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes (CFB group), suggesting it captures a fundamental bacterial genomic element that has been evolutionarily conserved. The feature doesn't appear to correlate with specific gene functions but rather with a positional or structural property of bacterial genome organization that transcends taxonomic boundaries.",
