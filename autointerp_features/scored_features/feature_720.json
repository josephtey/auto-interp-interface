  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, identifying strong activation peaks consistently appearing in specific genomic contexts. I compared these peaks to gene annotations, looking for recurring patterns in position, strength, and genomic environment. I noticed the feature consistently activates with high intensity at gene junctions or intergenic regions between specific gene types.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation spikes (magnitude 3-4) at intergenic regions, particularly at the ends of genes and just before the start of downstream genes. These activation sites frequently appear at the 3' end of metabolic enzymes, transporters, or regulatory proteins, and are often found just before genes involved in transcription/translation processes or cellular housekeeping functions. This pattern appears across diverse bacterial phyla, suggesting it detects a conserved genomic element.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects a significant biological pattern likely representing bacterial transcription termination sites or regulatory elements at gene boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature detects bacterial transcription termination sites or intergenic regulatory elements. It consistently shows sharp activation spikes at the 3' end of genes, particularly where there's a transition between functional gene categories. The feature likely identifies rho-independent terminators or similar structures that form stem-loop patterns in DNA. These elements are critical for proper transcription termination and potentially gene expression regulation. The pattern is highly consistent across examples and appears in diverse bacterial phyla, indicating it detects a fundamental and widely conserved genomic element involved in transcriptional control mechanisms.",
