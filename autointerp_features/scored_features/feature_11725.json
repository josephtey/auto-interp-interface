  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image carefully, focusing on where the activation spikes appear in relation to genomic annotations. In each case, there's a distinct, sharp activation peak in a specific location within the 10kb region. I examined what genes or elements exist at these activation points and looked for patterns across all examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at specific gene boundaries or intergenic regions. Most notably, in multiple examples (sections 4, 7, 9), activation occurs near or at tRNA genes (tRNA-fMet in section 4) or at positions with distinct structural transitions in the genome. There appears to be a strong correlation with regulatory boundaries or transition points between coding and non-coding regions, possibly indicating either a structural DNA feature or regions involved in transcription regulation.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern associated with specific genomic boundaries, particularly tRNA genes and regulatory regions.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific genomic boundaries with a strong preference for tRNA genes (particularly tRNA-fMet) and intergenic regulatory regions. The feature consistently produces sharp activation spikes precisely at these transition points, suggesting recognition of either a specific sequence motif present in these regions or a structural DNA characteristic at these boundaries. The biological function likely relates to transcription initiation or termination signals, or structural features that demarcate gene boundaries. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with discrete activation spikes at similar genomic contexts, suggesting this feature captures a fundamental organizational element within bacterial genomes. It may serve important roles in genome organization, gene expression regulation, or DNA replication.",
