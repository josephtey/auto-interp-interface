{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples to identify common genomic elements that might trigger the feature activation. I observed that in all cases, the feature shows sharp, distinct spikes rather than continuous activation, suggesting it detects a specific sequence motif or boundary element rather than gene content. I noted the precise genomic position of each peak and examined what annotations were present at or near these positions.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp activation spikes at gene boundaries, particularly at the start/end junctions between coding sequences. The strongest activations appear to be at locations where genes are in close proximity or slightly overlapping, suggesting this feature may detect specific gene transition motifs or regulatory elements positioned between genes. The feature appears to be organism-independent, as it shows similar activation patterns across various bacterial species including Streptomyces, Cronobacter, Sutterella, Thermotoga, Xanthomonas, and others.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern related to gene boundary transitions or intergenic regulatory motifs.",

  "description": "This feature detects gene junctions or boundary regions between adjacent coding sequences. It shows strong spike-like activations at locations where genes are closely positioned or slightly overlapping, suggesting detection of specific sequence signals used in gene transition regions. These signals may relate to transcription termination or initiation sites, ribosome binding sites, or other regulatory elements positioned between genes. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial taxa, indicating it captures a fundamental genomic organizational feature rather than species-specific elements. The sharp, distinct activation profile suggests recognition of a specific sequence motif rather than general compositional bias.",
