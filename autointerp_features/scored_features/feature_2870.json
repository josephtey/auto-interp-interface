  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify patterns in the feature activation in relation to genomic annotations. For each example, I examined where activation peaks occurred relative to annotated elements, noting their strength, shape, and genomic context. I then compared across examples to identify consistent patterns.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, I observed a clear pattern of strong, sharp activation peaks that consistently coincide with tRNA genes or their immediate vicinity. Examples include trnC (section_2), trnA (section_9), and trnS (section_5). The feature activation occurs as distinct spikes rather than broad regions. In some examples where no tRNA is directly annotated, the activation may correspond to unannotated tRNA-like elements or other structured RNA features like CRISPR repeats (sections 1, 3, 6). The pattern is highly specific, with activation occurring precisely at these structured RNA locations.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects tRNA genes and possibly other structured RNA elements, representing a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and possibly other structured RNA elements like CRISPR repeats. The activation pattern appears as sharp, distinct spikes precisely at the location of these elements, rather than broad regions of activation. The feature likely recognizes the characteristic structural patterns of tRNA genes, which contain highly conserved secondary structure elements (cloverleaf structure) and sequence motifs. The detection is highly specific and consistent across examples, suggesting this feature has learned to identify the unique sequence and structural signatures of tRNAs in bacterial genomes. Functionally, this feature may be helpful for identifying elements involved in translation machinery and RNA processing. The pattern is consistent across diverse bacterial genomes, indicating it captures a fundamental and conserved biological signal.",
