  "reasoning": "I examined each example to identify patterns in the feature activation spikes across different genomic regions. I noted the precise locations of activation peaks in relation to annotated genomic elements, looking for consistent patterns across all examples. I paid special attention to what types of genes or elements were consistently present near activation sites, as well as the strength and shape of activation patterns.",
  "findings": "In all examples, I observed sharp, strong activation spikes occurring in close proximity to tRNA genes. In section_7, the spike appears near trnV (tRNA-Val); in section_1, near trnA (tRNA-Ala); in section_9, near trnR (tRNA-Arg). Where tRNAs aren't explicitly annotated, the feature activation appears at positions that likely contain unannotated tRNA genes based on contextual clues and genomic positioning. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent - always appearing as a sharp, distinct spike rather than a broad activation region, suggesting high specificity for tRNA gene detection.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently and specifically detects tRNA genes across different genomic contexts, representing a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes in bacterial genomes. The activation manifests as sharp, distinct spikes directly at or very near tRNA gene locations. The consistency of this pattern across multiple examples with different tRNA types (tRNA-Val, tRNA-Ala, tRNA-Arg) indicates the feature has learned to recognize common structural or sequence characteristics shared by tRNA genes, regardless of their specific anticodon. This recognition likely relates to the highly conserved secondary structure of tRNAs (cloverleaf structure) or their promoter elements. The feature shows high specificity and sensitivity, firing strongly only at tRNA locations while remaining inactive elsewhere in the genome, making it a reliable indicator of tRNA gene presence in genomic sequences.",
