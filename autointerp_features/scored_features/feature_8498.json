  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify genomic elements at or near activation points. The feature consistently shows sharp, spike-like activation patterns over or near RNA polymerase sigma factors (RpoH, RpoN) and other transcriptional regulatory elements. In multiple examples, activation occurs precisely at transcriptional regulators or elements associated with RNA polymerase function. Examples include sigma-70 factors, sigma-54 factors (RpoN), and sigma factor RpoH. The activation signals are high amplitude, discrete spikes rather than broad regions.",
  "findings": "The feature activates strongly at or immediately adjacent to RNA polymerase sigma factors and transcriptional regulators across different bacterial genomes. In example 5, activation occurs at RNA polymerase factor sigma-54 (rpoN). In example 8, activation is at RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoH. Example 7 shows activation near ribosomal protein L27, which interacts with the translation machinery. This suggests the feature detects conserved sequence motifs associated with transcriptional regulation machinery, particularly sigma factors that direct RNA polymerase to specific promoters.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects RNA polymerase sigma factors and related transcriptional regulatory elements across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects RNA polymerase sigma factors and closely related transcriptional regulatory elements. It shows consistent sharp spike activations directly at sigma factor genes (RpoH, RpoN) or other transcriptional regulators. The feature likely recognizes conserved sequence motifs in these regulatory proteins that direct RNA polymerase to specific promoter regions. These sigma factors are critical for bacterial gene expression regulation, determining which genes are transcribed under different conditions. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with discrete, high-amplitude activations corresponding precisely to transcriptional regulatory machinery, suggesting the feature has learned biologically significant sequence characteristics of bacterial transcription initiation components.",
