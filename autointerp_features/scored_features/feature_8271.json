  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, focusing on their relationship to annotated genomic elements. For each example, I examined where peak activations occurred relative to genome annotations, noting consistent patterns across examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows high activation patterns proximal to CRISPR elements. In multiple examples (sections 2, 9, 3, 5, 1), strong activation peaks appear directly at or near CRISPR spacers/repeats. The feature activates most strongly when detecting CRISPR spacer elements, showing a characteristic pattern of consecutive narrow spikes. The pattern is highly specific and appears conserved across different genomes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects CRISPR spacer elements and associated structures in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) spacer sequences and occasionally CRISPR repeat regions in bacterial genomes. The activation pattern consistently shows sharp, narrow spikes with high amplitude directly corresponding to CRISPR elements. The feature shows strongest activation directly over CRISPR spacer sequences, which are DNA segments derived from previous viral infections that enable bacterial adaptive immunity against phages. This pattern is remarkably consistent across examples, appearing in sections 2, 9, 3, 5, and 1, all of which contain annotated CRISPR elements. The biological significance relates to bacterial defense mechanisms against phage infection, and the feature likely captures sequence motifs common to CRISPR systems. The pattern is highly specific and consistently discriminates CRISPR elements from other genomic features.",
