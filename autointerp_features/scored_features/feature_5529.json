  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I noted the precise locations where the feature shows strong activation (appearing as sharp spikes in the visualization) and examined the surrounding genomic elements. I then looked for commonalities across all examples to determine what specific genomic element this feature might be detecting.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong spike activation at or near tRNA genes, particularly tRNA-Leu(tag). In examples where tRNA annotations are present (section_6.png and section_9.png), the feature activation spike precisely aligns with the tRNA location. In other examples, the spike appears at locations that likely contain unannotated tRNA genes or similar RNA structures. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent - a sharp, distinct spike without broader activation patterns, suggesting recognition of a specific sequence motif rather than a broader genomic context.",
  "conclusion": "This feature strongly and specifically detects tRNA genes, particularly tRNA-Leu with UAG anticodon, representing a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature detects transfer RNA genes, with particular specificity for tRNA-Leu with the UAG anticodon. The feature produces sharp, high-magnitude activation spikes precisely at the tRNA gene location. In examples where tRNA annotations are present (sections 6 and 9), the activation directly overlaps the tRNA-Leu(tag) gene. In other examples, the spike likely indicates unannotated tRNA genes or similar RNA structures. tRNAs are essential non-coding RNAs that deliver amino acids to ribosomes during protein synthesis, making their detection biologically significant. The detection pattern is highly consistent across examples, always appearing as a distinct, sharp spike rather than a broader activation pattern, suggesting recognition of the conserved tRNA sequence or structural elements.",
