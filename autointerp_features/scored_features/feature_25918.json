{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, noting their locations, strengths, and relationships to genomic annotations. I observed the feature consistently activates strongly around specific RNA elements, particularly tRNAs, in bacterial genomes (mostly Firmicutes).",
  "findings": "Strong, characteristic activation peaks consistently appear directly over or adjacent to tRNA genes in multiple examples. In section_2, section_3, and section_8, the feature shows clear, high activation directly over tRNA-Leu genes (IDs 11, 2, and 3 respectively). The activation pattern forms distinctive blocks with sharp boundaries, suggesting recognition of the structured tRNA genes or their immediate context. Most examples are from Firmicutes bacteria (Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, etc.), indicating potential phylum-specific detection.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects tRNA genes, particularly tRNA-Leu, across bacterial genomes with high specificity and signal strength.",
  "title": "tRNA gene detection, especially tRNA-Leu",
  "activation-pattern": "continuous",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes in bacterial genomes, with particularly strong signals for tRNA-Leu. The feature activates directly over the tRNA gene sequence with clear, defined boundaries. This pattern likely represents detection of the characteristic cloverleaf secondary structure elements or sequence motifs unique to tRNA genes. The activation is remarkably consistent across examples from different Firmicutes bacteria (Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, etc.), suggesting conservation of tRNA structural features across species. In some cases where tRNAs aren't directly annotated, the activation may indicate unannotated tRNA genes or related RNA structural elements. This feature could be useful for identifying tRNA genes in newly sequenced bacterial genomes.",
