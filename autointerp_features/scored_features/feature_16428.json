  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully to identify patterns in the feature activation. In all examples, there is a consistent sharp spike of activation that appears at the left edge of the viewing window. The activation is extremely discrete and localized, showing a strong signal at a very specific position rather than a broader region. The spike doesn't seem associated with any particular gene function across examples, as the annotations near the activation point vary widely between examples.",
  "findings": "The activation consistently appears at the exact same position relative to the viewing window (leftmost edge) in all examples, regardless of the genomic content or organism. This suggests the feature is detecting a technical aspect of the data representation rather than a biological element. The neighboring genes show no functional consistency across examples - ranging from metabolic enzymes, transporters, chaperones, hypothetical proteins, and various other functional categories with no apparent pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely captures a technical artifact in the data processing or representation rather than a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature consistently activates at the leftmost edge of the 10kb viewing window in all examples, suggesting it's detecting the boundary of the data representation window rather than any specific genomic element. The spike occurs at approximately the same position in each example regardless of the biological context or neighboring genes. The consistent technical positioning without biological correlation across diverse genome examples indicates this is likely an artifact of the data processing or visualization method rather than a biologically meaningful signal. This feature may be useful for identifying window boundaries but does not appear to capture any specific genomic element or biological function.",
