  "reasoning": "I examined each example individually, looking for patterns in feature activation peaks and their relationship to genomic annotations. I focused on sharp, distinct activation spikes rather than broad regions of activation. Across all examples, I observed the feature consistently activates at specific positions, forming sharp, narrow spikes rather than broad regions of activation. The activation is typically high intensity (ranging from 0.75 to 2.0), suggesting strong recognition of a specific pattern.",
  "findings": "Across all 10 examples, this feature consistently activates at positions near the boundaries between genes or at intergenic regions. The activation pattern appears as distinct sharp spikes rather than broad activation regions. The feature doesn't appear to target specific gene families or functions, as the genes adjacent to activation sites vary widely in function (oxidoreductases, tRNAs, hypothetical proteins, etc.). In examples where tRNAs are annotated (section_0 with tRNA-Pro, section_6 with tRNA-Lys), the feature shows strong activation. This suggests the feature may be detecting structural elements common in non-coding regions, possibly related to transcriptional boundaries or regulatory elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect intergenic regions or gene boundaries, potentially capturing regulatory elements or structural motifs at these transition zones.",

  "description": "This feature detects sharp boundaries between genes or specific intergenic elements, characterized by distinct activation spikes at gene transitions rather than within coding sequences. The feature shows particular sensitivity to regions near tRNAs and gene boundaries, suggesting it may capture promoter elements, termination signals, or structural motifs associated with transcriptional junctions. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, always appearing as distinct spikes at transition zones rather than within gene bodies. This likely represents recognition of conserved sequence or structural patterns that function in transcriptional regulation, potentially including -10/-35 promoter boxes, terminators, or other regulatory motifs that occur at gene boundaries.",
