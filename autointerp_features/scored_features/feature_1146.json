  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I particularly focused on where the strongest activations occurred, which genomic elements were consistently present near these peaks, and whether any biological patterns emerged across different organisms.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, localized activation peaks in diverse bacterial genomes, including firmicutes, proteobacteria, and cyanobacteria. The activation peaks mostly appear at specific locations near cell fate regulatory proteins (YaaT in Symbiobacterium), RNA polymerase factors (sigma factors in multiple organisms), DNA mismatch repair proteins (MutS), CRISPR-associated elements, and stress response systems. The feature appears to recognize sequence or structural motifs associated with transcriptional regulation and stress response mechanisms that are functionally conserved across diverse bacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with bacterial regulatory elements involved in transcriptional control and stress responses.",
  "title": "Bacterial transcriptional regulator detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature detects genomic regions containing transcriptional regulatory elements, particularly RNA polymerase sigma factors and stress response regulators. The feature consistently activates with strong, localized spikes near genes encoding regulatory proteins such as RNA polymerase sigma factors (seen in examples 3, 4, 5), cell fate regulators (YaaT), and DNA repair/stress response elements. The positioning is typically within or at the boundary of these regulatory genes. Biologically, this likely represents recognition of conserved sequence motifs associated with bacterial transcriptional regulation systems that control gene expression during environmental stress or physiological transitions. The pattern is highly consistent across examples spanning diverse bacterial phyla (firmicutes, proteobacteria, cyanobacteria), suggesting the feature detects a fundamental bacterial regulatory mechanism conserved through evolution.",
