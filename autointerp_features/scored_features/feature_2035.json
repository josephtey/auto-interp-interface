  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genome annotations. I noted the spike-like activation pattern consistently appears at specific genomic elements. In examples where tRNA genes are present (sections 1 and 8), the activation peak directly aligns with these non-coding RNA elements. The activation pattern is distinctly sharp and precise, reaching maximum intensity at these elements with no gradual buildup or decay. In examples without visible tRNA annotations, the activation appears at positions that may contain other non-coding RNA elements (e.g., purine riboswitch in section_0).",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNAs. In section_1, activation precisely aligns with trnR (tRNA-Arg). In section_8, activation aligns with trnG (tRNA-Gly). In section_0, activation coincides with a purine riboswitch. These activation patterns show sharp, high-intensity spikes exactly at these elements rather than at protein-coding genes. The positioning is highly specific and doesn't extend to neighboring regions, suggesting precise recognition of RNA structural elements rather than protein-coding sequences or regulatory regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects non-coding RNA elements in bacterial genomes, particularly tRNA genes and riboswitches.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and other structured non-coding RNA elements in bacterial genomes. The feature produces sharp activation spikes precisely at the location of these RNA elements, with no activation in surrounding regions. The detection appears independent of the specific tRNA type (observed with both tRNA-Arg and tRNA-Gly) and extends to other structured non-coding RNAs like riboswitches. This likely represents recognition of conserved RNA structural elements or sequence motifs characteristic of non-coding functional RNAs. The pattern is highly consistent across examples where these elements are present, suggesting this feature has learned to distinguish the unique signatures of structured non-coding RNAs from protein-coding sequences.",
