  "reasoning": "I examined the feature activation pattern across ten genomic examples, focusing on the relationship between activation spikes and nearby genomic annotations. The feature consistently shows sharp, distinct activation spikes at specific genomic locations rather than broad regions of activation.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at or near transfer RNA (tRNA) processing enzymes and RNA modification proteins. In multiple examples (sections 1, 9, 3, 4, and others), the activation spike occurs at or near genes involved in RNA metabolism, particularly tRNA modification enzymes like TruA (tRNA pseudouridine synthase) and CMP kinase (cmk). The pattern suggests this feature detects sequence motifs associated with RNA processing machinery or specific RNA modification sites.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern related to RNA processing enzymes, particularly those involved in tRNA modification.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific sequence motifs associated with tRNA modification enzymes and RNA processing machinery. The feature consistently shows sharp activation spikes at or near genes encoding RNA-modifying enzymes like TruA (tRNA pseudouridine synthase), CMP kinase, and ribonucleases. These enzymes are critical for post-transcriptional RNA processing and modification, particularly of tRNAs, which are essential for accurate translation. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with sharp spikes rather than broad activation regions, suggesting the feature recognizes specific sequence motifs rather than broader genomic contexts. This likely represents recognition of conserved catalytic domains or RNA-binding motifs within these enzymes that are critical for their function in RNA metabolism.",
