  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, noting their locations relative to genome annotations. I observed a consistent pattern where high activation peaks correlate with CRISPR elements (either repeats, spacers, or arrays) in multiple examples. In examples without direct CRISPR annotations, activations often occur near genes associated with CRISPR systems (e.g., cas1c).",
  "findings": "Strong activation peaks consistently appear at or near CRISPR-related elements in most examples. In section_1, the feature activates near a CRISPR repeat (ID 7). In section_2, activation occurs near a CRISPR spacer (ID 7). In section_0, activation peaks near cas1c and a CRISPR spacer. In section_3, activation directly overlaps with a CRISPR repeat (ID 3). In section_5, activation corresponds with a region containing a cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitch. In section_7, activation appears near a CRISPR array. This pattern suggests the feature detects sequence characteristics specific to CRISPR-associated DNA or related regulatory elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects CRISPR-associated elements across diverse bacterial genomes, representing a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR elements (repeats, spacers, and arrays) and associated regulatory regions. The feature shows strong, concentrated spike activations directly at or immediately adjacent to CRISPR-related sequences. Functionally, this likely represents detection of the characteristic repeat-spacer architecture or specific sequence motifs common in CRISPR systems, which play crucial roles in bacterial adaptive immunity against phage infection. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial phyla (including Firmicutes and Spirochetes), suggesting this feature captures fundamental and evolutionarily conserved aspects of CRISPR system architecture rather than organism-specific variations.",
