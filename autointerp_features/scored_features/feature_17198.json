  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all provided examples, focusing on the precise genomic locations where the feature shows high activation (sharp spikes). In each case, I analyzed what genes or elements were present at or near these activation points, looking for common patterns.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, sharp activation spikes near or within CRISPR elements (particularly CRISPR spacers) or transposable elements. In examples where CRISPR spacers are present (sections 0, 1, and 2), the activation spike appears in proximity to these elements. In other examples, the activation is associated with transposable elements (section 2 with IS110 family transposase) or occurs near genes involved in mobile genetic element defense (section 6 with traU, section 7 with abiEi). The pattern suggests recognition of foreign DNA or DNA involved in horizontal gene transfer and defense mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects genomic elements related to prokaryotic immune systems and mobile genetic elements, representing a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature detects elements associated with prokaryotic immune systems and mobile genetic elements, particularly CRISPR spacers and transposases. It shows sharp activation spikes precisely at or near these elements, which function in bacterial defense against foreign DNA. The activation pattern is highly consistent across examples, occurring at junction points between host genomes and mobile elements or defense systems. This likely represents the detection of sequence signatures that distinguish self from non-self DNA in bacterial genomes, which is critical for genome integrity and defense against phage infection. The feature could be identifying key sequence motifs that mark these regions as targets for defense systems or recognition sites for integration/excision machinery.",
