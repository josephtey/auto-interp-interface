  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify patterns in feature activation, noting where strong signals appear in relation to genomic annotations. I paid particular attention to consistent patterns across examples, focusing on what specific genomic elements correlate with activation peaks.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation at or near tRNA genes in multiple examples. In sections 2, 7, and 0, there are pronounced activation peaks directly aligned with tRNA genes (trnI, trnA, and trnQ respectively). In section 9, there's an activation spike near a CRISPR spacer sequence. In other examples (sections 1, 5, 8), activation occurs in specific regions without tRNAs but with consistent patterns. The feature appears to be detecting primarily tRNA genes or similar non-coding RNA structures based on the most consistent and strongest signals.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects tRNA genes and possibly other structured non-coding RNA elements across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes in bacterial genomes, showing sharp activation spikes directly at tRNA locations. In examples 2, 7, and 0, activation clearly coincides with tRNA-Ile, tRNA-Ala, and tRNA-Gln annotations respectively. The feature may also recognize similar structured non-coding RNAs like CRISPR spacers (seen in section 9). The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial species, suggesting the feature has learned conserved structural or sequence characteristics of tRNAs rather than species-specific patterns. This likely represents the detection of the distinctive cloverleaf secondary structure and conserved sequence elements typical of tRNAs, which are essential for protein translation across all bacterial lineages.",
