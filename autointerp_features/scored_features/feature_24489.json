  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully, noting the sharp activation spikes and their genomic context. I observed that these spikes consistently appear in specific locations relative to tRNAs and other RNA elements. I looked for patterns across all examples, identifying common elements that appear near activation peaks.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, the feature shows strong, narrow activation spikes near RNA elements, particularly tRNAs. In section_9, a 16S ribosomal RNA is highlighted (ID 5). In section_1, trnV (tRNA-Val) is present (ID 3). Section_2 shows activation near trnG (tRNA-Gly). Section_3 contains a tRNA-Xxx element. Several examples show activation near CRISPR RNA elements (sections 6 and 4). The activation pattern is highly consistent - always appearing as a sharp, localized spike rather than a broad region.",
  "conclusion": "This feature reliably detects specific RNA structural elements, particularly transfer RNAs and other non-coding RNA elements.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects structured RNA elements, with strong preference for tRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. The feature activation appears as a sharp, distinct spike directly at the RNA element location rather than in flanking regions. This suggests the feature is detecting specific sequence or structural characteristics unique to functional RNAs. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with section_9 showing 16S rRNA, section_1 showing tRNA-Val, section_2 showing tRNA-Gly, and section_3 showing an unspecified tRNA. Other structured RNAs like CRISPR elements also trigger activation. This feature likely represents the model's ability to distinguish highly structured, functional RNA elements from protein-coding sequences, an important distinction in genome organization and function.",
