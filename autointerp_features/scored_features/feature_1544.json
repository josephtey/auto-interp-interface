  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across multiple genomic regions from different bacterial species, focusing on where the strongest activations occurred in relation to genomic annotations. I looked for recurring elements or structures that consistently aligned with activation peaks.",
  "findings": "There's a strong correlation between the feature's activation and CRISPR elements, particularly CRISPR spacers and repeats. In examples where CRISPR arrays are annotated (sections 5 and 7), the activation peaks directly align with these elements. The feature shows specific detection of CRISPR-associated sequences with pronounced spikes occurring precisely at these locations. While some examples show activation in regions without explicit CRISPR annotations, the activation pattern is consistently characterized by distinct spikes rather than continuous signals.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with CRISPR elements in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR arrays, especially CRISPR spacer sequences and repeat structures. The feature shows strong, localized activation spikes precisely at CRISPR elements as seen in section_5 (IDs 6-8) and section_7 (IDs 6-8, 11). The activation pattern typically appears as distinct spikes rather than continuous signals, suggesting sensitivity to the specific sequence characteristics of CRISPR arrays. CRISPR systems are bacterial adaptive immune mechanisms that provide defense against phages and mobile genetic elements, and this feature appears to be capturing their characteristic sequence patterns. The feature is consistent across examples where CRISPR elements are annotated and appears in both gamma-proteobacteria and other bacterial taxa, suggesting it detects a conserved structural property of CRISPR sequences rather than organism-specific patterns.",
