  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image carefully, noting the precise positions of activation peaks and their relationship to genomic annotations. I paid special attention to where the strongest activation signals appeared, identifying which genomic elements were consistently present at these locations. I looked for patterns across examples to determine if the feature was detecting a specific type of genomic element.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, I observed strong, sharp activation peaks that consistently appear at or near tRNA genes. In section_9, there's clear activation at a tRNA-Arg gene (ID 15). In section_5, activation coincides with 5S rRNA (ID 1) and nearby tRNA-Ile (ID 6). The activation pattern is remarkably specific, showing sharp, distinct spikes rather than broad regions of activation. The feature appears to be detecting non-coding RNA elements, particularly tRNA genes, with high specificity regardless of the surrounding genomic context or organism.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with transfer RNA genes and other non-coding RNA elements.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA genes and potentially other small non-coding RNA elements in genomic sequences. The activation pattern shows sharp, distinct spikes precisely at the location of tRNA genes, with minimal activation elsewhere. This suggests the feature has learned to recognize the highly conserved structural characteristics of tRNA genes, which are essential for protein translation across all domains of life. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse genomic examples and different organisms, indicating the feature's robust ability to identify these critical RNA elements regardless of surrounding genomic context. This specificity would be valuable for annotating tRNA genes in newly sequenced genomes.",
