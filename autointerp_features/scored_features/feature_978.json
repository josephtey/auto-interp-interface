  "reasoning": "I analyzed the genomic context of high-activation patterns across multiple bacterial species, focusing on annotations near activation peaks. I searched for consistent associations between gene functions and activation patterns, examining both the identity of genes and their relative positions to activation peaks.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, the activation peaks consistently appear at or very near tRNA genes, particularly tRNA-Gly genes. In section_1, activation coincides with trnG (tRNA-Gly). In section_0, activation peaks near trnG (tRNA-Gly). In section_5, activation corresponds to trnK (tRNA-Lys). These strong activation signals occur regardless of the neighboring protein-coding genes, suggesting that the feature specifically detects tRNA structures or sequences rather than protein-coding contexts.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes across diverse bacterial species, with particular sensitivity to glycine tRNAs.",
  "title": "tRNA gene detector (Gly/Lys preference)",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA genes in bacterial genomes, with highest sensitivity for glycine tRNAs (tRNA-Gly) and some responsiveness to lysine tRNAs (tRNA-Lys). The activation pattern shows sharp, distinct spikes precisely at the tRNA locations, regardless of surrounding coding sequences. This suggests the feature is recognizing either the characteristic cloverleaf secondary structure of tRNAs, specific sequence motifs within these tRNAs, or promoter elements associated with tRNA transcription. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial taxa (including Flammeovirga, Ureaplasma, and Spiroplasma), indicating these structures are evolutionarily conserved. The biological significance relates to translation machinery, which requires accurate detection of tRNAs for proper protein synthesis.",
