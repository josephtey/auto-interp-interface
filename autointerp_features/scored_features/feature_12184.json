  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns in each image, noting where the feature had high activation relative to the genomic annotations. I focused on the consistent patterns across examples, determining if the feature responds to specific genetic elements, motifs, or structures.",
  "findings": "The feature shows consistent high activation across extended coding sequences (CDSs) in various bacterial genomes. The activation pattern typically spans the entire length of genes, with stronger activation often in the middle of longer genes. The feature does not show preference for specific gene functions but rather responds to the protein-coding nature of sequences. It shows consistent suppression at gene boundaries and intergenic regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to protein-coding sequences regardless of specific function.",

  "description": "This feature detects extended protein-coding regions (CDSs) across bacterial genomes. The activation spans the length of coding sequences with higher intensity typically in the central regions of genes. The feature shows low activation in intergenic regions and at gene boundaries, suggesting it's responding to characteristics of assembled coding regions rather than promoters or terminators. It does not appear to discriminate between specific gene functions, as it activates across diverse functional categories including metabolic enzymes, transporters, transcriptional regulators, and hypothetical proteins. This pattern suggests the feature has learned to recognize fundamental properties of protein-coding sequences such as codon usage patterns, GC content, or other sequence biases common to coding regions. The consistency across diverse bacterial genomes indicates this is a robust genomic pattern detector.",
