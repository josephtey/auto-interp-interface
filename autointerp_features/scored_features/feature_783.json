  "reasoning": "I analyzed 10 genomic visualizations, focusing on activation patterns and their relationship to genomic annotations. I examined peak locations relative to annotations, strength patterns, and gene contexts. I identified recurring patterns across examples, specifically noticing that strong activation spikes consistently appeared at CRISPR spacer sequences or at the boundaries of CRISPR-related elements.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, sharp activation peaks specifically at CRISPR spacer sequences or their boundaries in multiple examples. In section_1, section_4, and section_8, there are clear activations directly at CRISPR spacer annotations. The activation appears to be detecting specific sequence motifs within CRISPR spacers rather than the repeats themselves. The feature demonstrates consistent recognition of these elements across various bacterial genomes, suggesting a recognition of conserved sequence patterns within CRISPR systems.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures biologically meaningful patterns related to CRISPR spacer sequences, showing consistent activation across multiple bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR spacer sequences across bacterial genomes. The activations appear as strong, localized spikes directly at the position of CRISPR spacers or at their boundaries. The feature likely recognizes specific sequence motifs characteristic of CRISPR spacers, which are crucial components of bacterial adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements like phages. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple examples from diverse bacterial species, with strong activation spikes seen in sections 1, 4, and 8 precisely at annotated CRISPR spacers. This suggests the feature is capturing fundamental sequence characteristics conserved across CRISPR systems in different bacterial taxa.",
