  "reasoning": "I examined the activation patterns across all examples, noting where the feature shows strong activation spikes and identifying their genomic contexts. I particularly focused on consistent patterns in what genomic elements are present at or near activation sites, and looked for recurring relationships with specific gene types, structures, or functional elements.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp, single-position activation spikes rather than broad regions of activation. In multiple examples, these spikes appear at or near tRNA genes (section_4 shows tRNA-fMet, section_2 shows tRNA-Ala) or RNA-related elements. In other examples, the spikes occur near transcriptional machinery components (RNA polymerase in section_6, section_5) or at transition points between genes. The pattern suggests detection of specific RNA-related elements or sequence motifs associated with RNA processing or gene expression regulation.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern related to tRNA genes or RNA processing sites in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects tRNA genes and potentially other structured RNA elements in bacterial genomes. The activation consistently appears as a sharp spike at a specific position within or adjacent to these RNA elements. In section_4, it activates near tRNA-fMet (tRNA) and in section_2 near tRNA-Ala. The feature appears to recognize sequence or structural motifs that define these RNA elements, particularly at boundaries or transition points. This likely represents recognition of conserved sequence patterns involved in RNA processing, transcription termination/initiation, or structured RNA elements. The pattern is highly consistent across examples where RNA elements are present, suggesting it captures an important functional element for gene expression regulation.",
