  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations, looking for consistent relationships across all examples. I focused on where activation peaks occurred, what genes or elements were present at these locations, and whether there were recurring patterns in activation shape or genomic context.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp, distinct activation spikes located at specific positions rather than broad regions. In most examples (sections 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9), the activation occurs as narrow spikes often at the beginning/end of gene boundaries or intergenic regions. The activation doesn't consistently correspond to a single gene family but rather appears to detect a structural or sequence motif that occurs at transition points between genes or near specific boundaries. CRISPR repeat elements are noted in two examples (sections 1 and 5) near activation sites, suggesting possible recognition of repetitive structural elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern related to genomic transition regions or specific sequence/structural motifs at gene boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature detects specific DNA sequence or structural motifs that frequently occur at genomic transition points or boundaries between genes. The activation pattern typically appears as sharp, isolated spikes rather than broad regions of activation, suggesting recognition of a specific short sequence element or structural motif. The feature activates near various gene types without obvious functional relationship between them, indicating it's detecting a structural element rather than specific gene function. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, always showing similar sharp activation spikes at what appear to be boundary regions or transition points in genome organization. This may represent recognition of specific regulatory elements, transcription terminators, or structural DNA features that function in genome organization and gene expression control.",
