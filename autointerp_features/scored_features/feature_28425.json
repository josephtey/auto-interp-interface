  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example carefully, noting activation patterns in relation to gene annotations. I observed strong, consistent activations within specific genes across multiple examples, with particular attention to the precise location and intensity of activation peaks. I looked for common themes in gene function, structure, or positioning that might explain the activation pattern.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, continuous activation across specific coding sequences, primarily within oxidoreductase proteins or metabolic enzymes. In examples 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9, we see high activation along F420-dependent oxidoreductases, FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, and related enzyme families. These activations consistently span substantial portions of these genes rather than just boundaries or specific motifs. The feature appears to be detecting sequence characteristics specific to oxidoreductase enzymes involved in redox reactions, particularly those dependent on FAD/FMN/F420 cofactors.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects a biologically meaningful pattern associated with oxidoreductase enzyme coding regions.",

  "description": "This feature primarily detects coding sequences for oxidoreductase enzymes, particularly those dependent on FAD, FMN, or F420 cofactors. Activation typically spans a substantial portion of these genes' coding regions. The feature shows strongest activation for F420-dependent oxidoreductases (example 0), FAD-dependent monooxygenases (example 3), and related enzymes involved in redox metabolic reactions. These enzymes share common sequence characteristics despite diverse specific functions. The feature likely captures conserved sequence patterns that reflect the cofactor-binding domains or catalytic sites characteristic of oxidoreductase enzymes. The detection pattern is highly consistent across bacterial genomes, suggesting evolutionary conservation of these enzyme sequences.",
