{
  "reasoning": "I carefully analyzed the activation patterns across 10 genomic regions, noting where high activations occurred in relation to annotated genes. I tracked the position of activation spikes, their magnitude, and the specific genes or features at or near these locations. I then looked for common patterns across all examples.",
  "findings": "In almost all examples, the feature shows strong activation spikes near CRISPR-related elements or their adjacent regions. In examples with visible CRISPR elements (sections 3, 7, 8, 9), activation peaks consistently appear near CRISPR repeats or spacers. Even in examples without labeled CRISPR regions, the activations tend to occur in genomic regions with transposases, mobile elements, or DNA-binding proteins that are often associated with genome defense systems. The strongest activations are typically sharp, discrete spikes rather than broad patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects CRISPR-associated genomic regions and related mobile genetic elements across diverse bacterial species.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR systems and related mobile genetic elements across bacterial genomes. The feature activates strongly near CRISPR repeats and spacers with sharp, discrete spikes. When CRISPR elements are not explicitly annotated, activation still occurs near genes often associated with genome defense like transposases and mobile elements. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla (including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and others), suggesting it detects a conserved sequence or structural motif characteristic of bacterial genome defense systems. This feature likely relates to the biological function of detecting and defending against foreign DNA, which is the primary role of CRISPR systems in bacteria.",
