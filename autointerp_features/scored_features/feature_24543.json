  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all provided examples, examining the relationship between feature activation and genomic annotations. I focused on identifying common elements where strong activation consistently occurs, paying special attention to the positioning relative to annotated regions and the presence of specific genomic elements.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong and consistent activation primarily at CRISPR-related elements in the genome. In examples 1, 5, 6, 9, and 2, there is distinct activation near CRISPR repeats or spacers. The activation pattern typically shows sharp spikes or concentrated areas of activation precisely at or near these CRISPR elements. Notably, in examples where continuous activation occurs (4, 7, 8), there is no CRISPR annotation visible, suggesting the feature may be detecting sequence characteristics common to CRISPR-associated regions even when not explicitly annotated.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects CRISPR-related genomic elements, representing a biologically meaningful pattern associated with bacterial immune systems.",
  "title": "CRISPR element detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) regions in bacterial genomes. The activation shows strong spikes directly at or adjacent to annotated CRISPR repeats and spacers. CRISPR systems function as adaptive immune mechanisms in bacteria, providing defense against foreign genetic elements like phages. The feature's activation is highly consistent in examples containing CRISPR annotations (1, 2, 5, 6, 9), demonstrating its specificity for these elements. The pattern suggests the feature may be detecting the characteristic palindromic repeat structure or spacer sequences that define CRISPR arrays, which are critical for bacterial defense mechanisms against foreign genetic material.",
