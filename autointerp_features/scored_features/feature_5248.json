  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, looking for consistent genomic elements that coincide with the feature activations. I paid special attention to the shape, strength, and location of activations relative to specific genomic annotations.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong, continuous activation patterns (typically reaching values of 4-6) spanning approximately 2-3kb regions. These activations do not consistently correspond to a single specific gene family or motif. Instead, they appear to detect non-coding regions with potential regulatory functions. The activations often appear in intergenic regions or regions containing non-coding RNAs (like the Guanidine-II riboswitch in example 1 and yybP-ykoY manganese riboswitch in example 0). Many activations are adjacent to transcription regulators or membrane/transport proteins.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect regulatory non-coding regions with specific sequence compositions.",
  "title": "Non-coding regulatory element detector",
  "activation-pattern": "continuous",
  "description": "This feature detects extended regions (2-3kb) of non-coding or intergenic DNA that likely serve regulatory functions. The feature activates strongly over regions containing or adjacent to riboswitches and other non-coding RNA elements (as seen in examples 0 and 1). It also frequently activates near genes involved in transcriptional regulation (HTH domain proteins, transcriptional regulators) and membrane/transport functions. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, always showing a continuous activation pattern rather than short spikes, suggesting it's detecting extended regulatory regions rather than specific binding sites. The biological function likely relates to genomic regions involved in gene expression control and environmental response regulation, possibly with distinctive GC content or structural properties that differentiate them from coding regions.",
