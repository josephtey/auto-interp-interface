  "reasoning": "I analyzed activation patterns across all 10 genomic sections, identifying consistent spikes relative to genomic features. Each spike shows sharp, localized activation (amplitude ~2.0) rather than broad regions. I mapped activations to neighboring genomic elements, noting junction points between genes and intergenic regions, and evaluated whether activations consistently occurred near specific gene families, regulatory elements, or structural motifs.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates as sharp, discrete spikes at what appear to be gene boundaries or intergenic transition points. There is no consistent association with specific gene types or families (examples include diverse genes like transporters, enzymes, and regulatory proteins). The feature appears to be detecting a sequence-specific motif or structural element that occurs at gene boundaries, possibly related to transcriptional regulation or translation initiation/termination. In section_5, notably, one activation occurs near a known regulatory element (TPP riboswitch).",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely detects a specific sequence motif at gene boundaries or regulatory regions rather than specific gene families.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific sequence motif that occurs predominantly at gene boundaries or intergenic regions. The sharp, singular spikes (consistently with amplitude ~2.0) suggest recognition of a precise sequence pattern rather than extended structural elements. The feature activates near various gene types without preference for gene function, suggesting it detects a common regulatory element or sequence signal used across diverse bacterial genomes. This could represent transcription terminators, promoter elements, or translation-related signals. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, always appearing as a distinct spike near gene endpoints, though the specific genes vary widely in function and organism. This motif likely plays a role in gene expression regulation or genome organization common across bacterial species.",
