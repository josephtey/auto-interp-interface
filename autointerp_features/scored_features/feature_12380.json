  "reasoning": "I analyzed the pattern of activation across 9 genomic examples, focusing on where the feature strongly activates and what genomic elements are present at those locations. In each example, the feature shows a sharp, isolated spike at a specific position, rather than broad activation over regions. I then searched for common elements at these activation sites.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at or near tRNA genes. In the examples where tRNAs are explicitly annotated (sections 1, 2, and 7), the activation spike directly aligns with tRNA-Arg(acg), tRNA-Val(gac), and tRNA-Lys(ttt) respectively. In other examples without explicit tRNA annotations, the activation pattern is identical - sharp spikes - suggesting the feature is detecting tRNA genes or a specific sequence motif associated with tRNAs. The feature shows no preference for genomic context beyond the tRNA itself, as neighboring genes vary across examples.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes across different genomic contexts and organisms, representing a biologically meaningful pattern.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes within bacterial genomes. The activation pattern shows a characteristic sharp spike directly at the tRNA location, regardless of the specific tRNA type (though several Arg, Val, and Lys tRNAs were observed). The consistent spike pattern suggests the feature recognizes either the characteristic cloverleaf secondary structure elements of tRNAs, conserved sequence motifs within tRNAs, or promoter elements associated with tRNA transcription. This feature could be useful for identifying tRNA genes in newly sequenced genomes. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with every activation spike corresponding to a tRNA gene position when annotated.",
