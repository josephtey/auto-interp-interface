  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I noted activation strength, position, and genomic context across all examples. I looked for consistent elements appearing near high activation regions and examined taxonomic patterns across organisms.",
  "findings": "Strong, consistent pattern of feature activation near or overlapping with tRNA genes in multiple examples. In section_0, section_6, and section_7, the feature shows high activation specifically at tRNA-Asp, tRNA-Gln, and tRNA-Thr/tRNA-Lys regions, respectively. When tRNAs are present in an example, the feature consistently activates, with strongest signals directly at or near the tRNA locations. The activation is often concentrated in dense clusters of spikes at these regions. Additionally, in section_8, a CRISPR spacer appears near activation, similar to what's seen in section_7 where both tRNA and CRISPR spacers are present.",
  "conclusion": "This feature strongly and consistently detects tRNA genes and potentially related RNA structural elements across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes across diverse prokaryotic genomes. Activation occurs precisely at the tRNA gene location, showing concentrated spike patterns. In multiple examples (sections 0, 6, and 7), the feature strongly activates at annotated tRNAs of different types (tRNA-Asp, tRNA-Gln, tRNA-Lys, tRNA-Thr). The feature likely recognizes the distinctive secondary structure elements or sequence motifs common to tRNAs rather than specific tRNA types, as it activates for various tRNA species. The pattern is highly consistent across examples containing tRNAs and spans diverse organisms including both bacteria and archaea, suggesting this represents a fundamental structural element conserved across prokaryotic domains.",
