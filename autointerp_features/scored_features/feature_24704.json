  "reasoning": "I examined the activation pattern in each image, noting the feature consistently shows sharp, narrow spike activations. I identified what genomic elements are present at each activation site and looked for commonalities across examples. The pattern appears consistently related to specific locations rather than being randomly distributed.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, isolated spike activations that consistently appear at or near tRNA genes (in examples where tRNAs are visible - section_9 and section_1) or at specific genomic boundaries or transition regions between genes. In section_1, the activation coincides with trnN (tRNA-Asn). In section_9, it appears near trnC (tRNA-Cys). In other examples, the activations occur at gene boundaries or specific intergenic regions. The feature appears to detect a specific sequence motif or structural element commonly found in these regions.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with specific nucleotide sequences likely found at tRNA genes and certain genomic boundaries.",

  "description": "This feature primarily detects tRNA genes and possibly similar sequence motifs found at specific genomic boundaries. It shows consistent, sharp spike activations exactly at tRNA locations in examples where tRNAs are annotated (trnN in section_1, trnC in section_9). In examples without visible tRNA annotations, the activations appear at specific boundaries between coding sequences or at intergenic regions that likely contain similar sequence motifs or structural elements. tRNAs have distinctive cloverleaf secondary structures and conserved sequence elements that make them recognizable, and this feature appears tuned to detect these characteristics. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, always presenting as a sharp, isolated spike rather than broad activations, suggesting detection of a specific sequence motif rather than a gene family or broader functional region.",
