  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully, looking for patterns in where the strong activation spikes occur in relation to the annotated genomic elements. I noted that in every example, there is a sharp, distinct activation spike that aligns precisely with specific RNA elements, particularly tRNAs. By comparing the activation positions with the annotation legends, I identified that the feature consistently activates at tRNA genes across multiple genomes.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, consistent activation at transfer RNA (tRNA) locations. Specifically, examples show activation at: tRNA-Leu(gag) in section_8, tRNA-Pro(cgg) and tRNA-Ala(tgc) in section_6, tRNA-Asp(gtc) in section_7, tRNA-Pro(tgg) in section_3, and 16S ribosomal RNA in section_0. The activation pattern is characterized by sharp, distinct spikes precisely at these non-coding RNA elements, with maximum amplitude consistently reaching ~1.0-1.5. This suggests the feature is specifically recognizing structural or sequence characteristics unique to tRNAs and other functional RNA elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to transfer RNA genes and other structured RNA elements across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA genes and other structured non-coding RNA elements like ribosomal RNA. The feature consistently produces sharp activation spikes precisely at the location of these RNA elements. The biological function represented is the recognition of the unique secondary structures and conserved sequences in tRNAs, which are essential for protein translation by carrying amino acids to ribosomes. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from various bacterial genomes, showing activation for different tRNA types (Leu, Pro, Asp, Ala) regardless of the flanking genetic context, indicating the feature has learned to recognize fundamental attributes of tRNA structure or sequence rather than contextual genomic patterns.",
