  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across the 10 examples, carefully noting where the feature activates strongly in relation to genomic annotations. In most examples, I observed strong, sharp activation peaks at specific locations rather than broad regions. I looked for patterns in what genes or elements appear near or at these activation sites, paying particular attention to repetitive elements, structural features, or specific gene families that might be detected consistently.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, the feature shows strong activation peaks that frequently appear at the end regions of annotated genes and intergenic regions. The activation pattern is consistent across diverse organisms (proteobacteria, archaea, thermotogales), suggesting it detects a sequence-specific motif rather than organism-specific elements. The feature doesn't correspond to any single gene family or function but appears related to a structural feature or sequence motif common across different bacterial and archaeal genomes, often at gene boundaries or termini.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture a biologically meaningful pattern related to sequence-specific terminators or boundary elements in prokaryotic genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects what appears to be transcription terminators or similar boundary elements at the ends of genes across diverse prokaryotic organisms. The activation consistently shows as sharp, strong spikes rather than broad regions, suggesting recognition of a specific sequence motif rather than a gene family. The feature activates in both bacteria (including proteobacteria, thermotogales) and archaea, indicating it detects a conserved genomic element found across prokaryotes. The pattern suggests the feature may be identifying rho-independent terminators or similar structural elements that mark the boundaries between genes, providing crucial signals for transcription termination. The consistency across taxonomically diverse prokaryotes suggests this is a fundamental genomic feature involved in basic gene expression regulation.",
