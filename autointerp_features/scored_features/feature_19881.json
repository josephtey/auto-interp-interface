{
  "reasoning": "I examined all examples to identify patterns in feature activation, paying close attention to where activation occurs in relation to genomic annotations. I tracked which genes or elements consistently appear with strong activations, and noted patterns in genome structure where the feature activates.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently shows strong activation across protein-coding sequences (CDS regions) of diverse bacterial genes. The activation pattern is continuous throughout CDS regions with occasional short gaps or drops at gene boundaries. The feature shows no preferential activation for specific gene functions, activating similarly for transporters, metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, and structural proteins. The activation signal abruptly starts at gene beginnings and ends at gene termination, indicating detection of general coding sequence characteristics rather than specific gene families.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects general properties of protein-coding sequences in bacterial genomes rather than specific gene families or motifs.",

  "description": "This feature detects protein-coding sequences (CDS) in bacterial genomes, regardless of their specific function. The feature activates continuously throughout CDS regions and shows sharp boundaries at the start and end of genes. In examples where non-coding elements appear (tRNAs, rRNAs, CRISPR repeats), the feature shows minimal or no activation, further confirming its specificity for protein-coding sequences. The feature likely captures fundamental characteristics of coding sequences such as codon usage patterns, GC content, or other sequence properties that distinguish coding from non-coding regions. This pattern is highly consistent across all examples, appearing in diverse bacterial species and across genes with widely varying functions, suggesting the feature has learned a fundamental property of bacterial coding sequences rather than specific gene families or motifs.",
