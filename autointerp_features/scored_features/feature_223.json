  "reasoning": "I examined each image to identify where the feature activates strongly, comparing activation patterns with genomic annotations. I looked for consistent patterns across examples, especially regarding peak locations relative to specific genes, regulatory elements, or structural features.",
  "findings": "Across all examples, the feature shows a consistent pattern of sharp, high-amplitude activation spikes. These spikes frequently appear near non-coding RNA (ncRNA) elements or at gene boundaries. Notably, in section_1, the activation is near ssrA (tmRNA), in section_2 near CRISPR elements, and in section_0 near a Cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitch. Several examples show activation near DNA repair genes (sbcC appears in multiple examples) or transcription regulatory elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to capture structured RNA elements and regulatory boundaries in bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature detects structured RNA elements and regulatory boundaries in bacterial genomes. It consistently shows sharp, high-amplitude activation spikes at or near non-coding RNA features (tmRNA, CRISPR repeats, riboswitches) and at transitions between genes with related regulatory functions. The feature activates particularly strongly near DNA repair genes (like sbcC), RNA-related elements, and transcriptional regulators. The biological function likely relates to identifying important regulatory junctions in bacterial genomes where structured RNA and/or transcriptional transitions occur. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with all showing identical sharp activation spikes at these functional boundaries.",
