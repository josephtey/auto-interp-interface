  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image carefully to identify patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I observed that each activation shows a distinct peak pattern that doesn't consistently align with any specific gene type or family. Instead, the activation appears in diverse genomic contexts across different bacterial and archaeal species. The peaks occur in regions with various functional genes without a clear pattern of co-occurrence.",
  "findings": "The feature activations appear in varied genomic contexts including metabolic genes, transport proteins, DNA repair systems, and hypothetical proteins. No consistent gene family, regulatory element, or sequence motif is evident across examples. The feature activates strongly in different taxonomic groups (proteobacteria, firmicutes, archaea) without preference. Activation peaks are pronounced (4-6 units high) and typically form a concentrated cluster rather than dispersed signals.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely detects a sequence-level pattern or structural motif that transcends specific gene functions, possibly related to DNA physical properties rather than specific functional elements.",

  "description": "This feature appears to detect a sequence-level or structural characteristic that occurs across diverse prokaryotic genomes rather than any specific gene family or functional element. The activation pattern consistently shows strong, clustered peaks (4-6 units high) appearing in varied genomic contexts without consistent association to particular gene types. The feature activates across diverse taxonomic groups including proteobacteria, euryarchaeotes, firmicutes, and spirochetes, suggesting it captures a fundamental sequence property independent of organism type. Given the lack of consistent functional annotation at activation sites, this likely represents a DNA physical property, compositional bias, or structural motif that can occur in different genomic contexts.",
