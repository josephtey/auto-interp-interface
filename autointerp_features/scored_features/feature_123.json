  "reasoning": "I analyzed the 10 genomic examples by examining activation patterns and their relationship to genomic annotations. For each example, I noted where activation peaks occurred relative to gene boundaries and intergenic regions, then looked for common patterns across examples. I investigated whether activations aligned with specific gene types, transcription start/end sites, or other genomic features.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp activation spikes at or near the boundaries between genes, typically at the 3' end of genes and/or 5' end of the following gene. These activation patterns appear in diverse bacterial species (proteobacteria, firmicutes, high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, spirochetes). The feature doesn't seem specific to particular gene functions, but rather to the genome architecture - specifically gene transitions. Most examples show strong activation at intergenic regions between divergently or convergently oriented genes, suggesting the feature may be detecting transcriptional termination sites, bidirectional promoters, or regulatory regions that occur at gene boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to bacterial gene boundaries and potential regulatory regions at gene transitions.",

  "description": "This feature detects bacterial gene boundaries, particularly at the junction between adjacent genes. The strong activation spikes consistently appear at intergenic regions, showing particular sensitivity to regions between convergent or divergent genes. This pattern likely represents detection of transcriptional regulatory elements such as terminators, bidirectional promoters, or other intergenic regulatory sequences. The feature appears to recognize a DNA sequence motif or structural property common to these boundary regions across diverse bacterial phyla. This suggests a broadly conserved genomic organizational feature related to transcriptional control and gene separation in bacteria. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from various bacterial species, indicating a fundamental aspect of bacterial genome architecture.",
