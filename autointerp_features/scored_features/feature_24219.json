  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all examples, noting their distribution, intensity, and positioning relative to genome annotations. I paid special attention to recurring patterns and consistent relationships between activations and specific genomic elements.",
  "findings": "The feature shows consistently strong, spike-like activations distributed throughout protein-coding sequences (CDS) across all examples. The activations appear as regularly spaced vertical spikes of similar height (typically 4-6 units) forming distinctive patterns across gene bodies. The activation is not limited to specific gene functions but appears consistently across diverse CDS regions regardless of gene function. The pattern is notably absent from intergenic regions or non-coding elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature detects a fundamental property of protein-coding sequences that transcends specific gene functions.",

  "description": "This feature robustly detects a sequence-level property common to protein-coding regions across diverse bacterial genomes. The spikes appear in regular intervals throughout coding sequences with remarkably consistent spacing and amplitude, suggesting detection of a fundamental property of coding DNA such as codon usage patterns or nucleotide composition biases that differentiate coding from non-coding regions. The pattern shows high specificity for CDS regions and appears independent of gene function, as it activates similarly across metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, membrane proteins, and hypothetical proteins. This suggests the feature has learned a fundamental sequence characteristic that defines protein-coding potential in bacterial genomes, likely related to codon structure, GC content patterns, or other signatures that distinguish coding from non-coding DNA. The consistency across diverse examples indicates this is a highly conserved property of bacterial coding sequences.",
