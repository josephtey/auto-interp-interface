{
  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully, noting the pattern of feature activation (sharp spikes) and their positions relative to genomic annotations. I observed that activations consistently occurred at specific positions, often near or at non-coding RNA elements or DNA structural features rather than protein-coding genes.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, the feature shows strong spike-like activation at positions associated with: tRNAs (section_0: tRNA-Asn and tRNA-Leu), CRISPR elements (section_1: CRISPR repeat, section_7: CRISPR spacer, section_8: CRISPR spacer), and small non-coding RNAs (section_9: gcvB RNA). The feature activations are precise, showing sharp peaks at these non-coding RNA positions rather than across coding sequences.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to structured non-coding RNA elements across different bacterial and archaeal genomes.",
  "title": "Non-coding RNA structural element detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects structured non-coding RNA elements including tRNAs, CRISPR repeats/spacers, and regulatory RNAs like gcvB. The feature shows strong, precise spike activations exactly at these elements, suggesting sensitivity to RNA secondary structure determinants rather than protein-coding sequences. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla (proteobacteria, firmicutes, spirochetes) and even archaea, indicating it detects fundamental RNA structural properties conserved across domains of life. This likely represents recognition of stable stem-loop or other tertiary structures important for non-coding RNA function in diverse cellular processes including translation, CRISPR-based immunity, and gene regulation.",
