  "reasoning": "I carefully analyzed each image, focusing on where the strong activation spikes occurred and the corresponding genomic annotations. I noted that in most examples, the strongest activations consistently appeared near tRNA annotations, particularly tRNA-fMet (formylmethionine tRNA) in several examples. The activation pattern showed sharp, distinct peaks precisely at these tRNA locations.",
  "findings": "The feature shows consistent, strong activation specifically at tRNA genes, particularly tRNA-fMet(cat) which is clearly labeled in examples 4 and 6. The peak activation is extremely precise, occurring directly at the tRNA location. While other genomic elements vary widely across examples (different protein-coding genes from various functional categories), the tRNA association remains constant. The activation is particularly strong with initiator tRNAs that are crucial for translation initiation in bacteria.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern specific to tRNA genes, particularly the initiator tRNA-fMet, which is essential for protein synthesis initiation in bacteria.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes, with strongest activation for initiator tRNA-fMet(cat) which carries the amino acid formylmethionine used for translation initiation in bacteria. The feature shows precise, high-amplitude spikes directly over the tRNA location, with minimal activation elsewhere. The pattern is highly consistent across examples from diverse bacterial taxa (\u03b1-proteobacteria, \u03b2-proteobacteria, \u03b3-proteobacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria), highlighting the evolutionary conservation of these essential RNA molecules. The feature likely detects sequence or structural motifs characteristic of tRNAs, particularly those specific to initiator tRNAs. This represents a fundamental biological element necessary for protein synthesis in all bacteria.",
