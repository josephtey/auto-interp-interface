  "reasoning": "I examined each image carefully to identify consistent patterns in feature activation across genomic regions. I looked for relationships between activation peaks and specific genomic annotations, their relative positions, and whether patterns were consistent across bacterial and archaeal examples.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation spikes at or near the 3' end of genes, particularly in transition regions between adjacent genes oriented in opposite directions. Multiple examples (sections 0, 2, 3, 7, 5, 6, 9, 1) show this pattern clearly. The feature appears to detect gene boundaries, especially where transcriptional direction changes. No specific gene family or function appears consistently associated with these activation sites, as the annotations vary widely across examples from hypothetical proteins to transporters, transcriptional regulators, and metabolic enzymes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature likely captures gene boundaries/termination sites where transcriptional direction changes, a biologically significant pattern related to genome organization.",

  "description": "This feature detects gene boundaries, particularly at the 3' end of genes where there is a transition to a gene oriented in the opposite direction. It shows strong, localized activation spikes at these transition points, suggesting sensitivity to sequence motifs associated with transcriptional termination or gene boundary regions. The precise positioning consistently shows activation at the end of one gene before the start of another running in the opposite direction. This pattern likely represents termination signals, stop codons, or intergenic regions with specific sequence characteristics that mark the boundary between genes. The feature is consistent across diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes, indicating it captures a fundamental genomic organizational element rather than taxon-specific patterns.",
