  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image showing feature activation patterns across genomic regions, focusing on where activations occur relative to annotated elements. I looked for consistent patterns across all examples, noting activation strength, location, and associated genomic elements. By comparing the 10 examples, I searched for common genetic elements or sequences that consistently appeared with high activation.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation in regions containing CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) elements. Specifically, activations occur at or near CRISPR repeats and spacers (sections 0, 1, 2, 4). The highest activations (intensity 3-4) are observed in regions containing CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins and CRISPR repeats. Section 2 shows activation near cas8c and a tRNA-Glu gene. Section 0 shows activation at CRISPR repeats and spacers. The pattern is less pronounced in sections without CRISPR systems but may detect similar structural elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects CRISPR repeat regions and associated elements, representing a biologically meaningful pattern important for bacterial adaptive immunity.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects CRISPR repeat sequences and their surrounding genomic context. The activation pattern shows strong, clustered spikes typically spanning CRISPR repeat arrays and nearby Cas genes. The feature likely recognizes the characteristic palindromic repeat structure of CRISPR arrays, which form an essential component of bacterial adaptive immunity systems. The consistent activation near these elements across different genomic contexts suggests the feature is capturing the unique sequence or structural signatures of CRISPR systems. This pattern is highly consistent in examples containing CRISPR elements, with activation strength proportional to the density of CRISPR repeats in the region.",
