  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across 10 genomic examples, examining how the feature responds to different genomic elements. I noted that high activations consistently appear in regions that don't directly correspond to coding sequences but rather in intergenic regions that may contain regulatory elements. The activation pattern shows strong, continuous signals that span several hundred to a few thousand base pairs, often positioned between specific genes.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates in intergenic regions, frequently between transcriptional regulators (TetR family, AcrR family) and transporters or metabolic genes. In examples 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9, activations occur near regulatory proteins. The pattern appears in diverse bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria (\u03b1-, \u03b3-), Firmicutes, and CFB group bacteria. The absence of activation within coding sequences and presence in potential regulatory regions suggests this feature detects bacterial promoter regions or other regulatory elements.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to bacterial gene regulation, likely detecting promoter regions or other regulatory elements in intergenic spaces.",
  "title": "Bacterial intergenic regulatory element detector",
  "activation-pattern": "continuous",
  "description": "This feature detects intergenic regions in bacterial genomes that likely contain regulatory elements such as promoters or enhancers. The activation consistently occurs between genes, often upstream of transporters, metabolic enzymes, or transcription factors, suggesting promoter or regulatory function. The feature activates across diverse bacterial phyla, indicating it detects a conserved regulatory pattern rather than a taxon-specific element. The signal pattern is continuous with variable intensity across hundreds to thousands of bases, consistent with the complex structure of bacterial regulatory regions that may contain multiple binding sites for transcription factors. This feature likely plays an important role in identifying regulatory components that control bacterial gene expression.",
