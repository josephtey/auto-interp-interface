  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify the relationship between feature activation and genomic elements. I noted that in all examples, feature activation appears as singular sharp spikes (high amplitude, narrow width) that consistently coincide with or appear adjacent to CRISPR-related elements or in genomic regions with multiple hypothetical proteins.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong activation spikes near CRISPR elements in examples 3, 8, and 9. In examples where CRISPR elements are not directly visible, the activation occurs in regions with clusters of hypothetical proteins or near genes involved in DNA binding, transcriptional regulation, or genome defense. The spike pattern is remarkably consistent - always appearing as a sharp, discrete peak rather than a broad activation region.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects CRISPR-associated regions or potential mobile genetic element interfaces, suggesting a role in identifying bacterial immune system components or integration sites.",
  "title": "CRISPR-adjacent genomic boundary detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects genomic boundaries associated with CRISPR systems or CRISPR-adjacent regions. It activates precisely at the interface between CRISPR elements and neighboring genes, or at potential mobile genetic element insertion sites characterized by clusters of hypothetical proteins. The sharp, isolated activation spikes likely represent recognition of specialized nucleotide motifs that serve as markers for genome defense systems or integration hotspots. This pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial genomes, suggesting the feature has captured a fundamental sequence characteristic of prokaryotic immune system architecture. The biological function may relate to identifying potential targets for CRISPR-Cas systems or recognizing boundaries of horizontally transferred genetic elements.",
