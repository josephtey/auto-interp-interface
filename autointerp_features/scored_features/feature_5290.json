  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across all provided examples to identify consistent genome features associated with high activation. I focused on the precise location of activation peaks in relation to gene annotations, noting the type and function of genes near activation sites. I looked for common biological elements, positional patterns, and functional relationships between genes where the feature activates strongly.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows strong activation near ATP synthase subunits and energy metabolism genes. In examples 9, 6, and 0, there are clear activations near atpB (F0F1 ATP synthase subunit A) and atpH (F0F1 ATP synthase subunit delta). Additional strong activations occur near ribosomal proteins (rpsK, rplD, rpmI) and membrane transport systems. The activation peaks are typically sharp and precise, occurring at specific locations within or at the boundaries of these genes, suggesting the feature may detect a specific nucleotide motif common to ATP synthesis and energy metabolism genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with ATP synthase components and energy metabolism genes.",
  "title": "ATP synthase/energy metabolism gene detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects genomic elements associated with ATP synthase components and other energy metabolism genes. The activation pattern shows precise, strong spikes primarily at the start or within coding regions of ATP synthase subunits (atpB, atpH) and related energy metabolism genes. The feature also shows affinity for ribosomal proteins and certain membrane transporters, suggesting it may detect a conserved nucleotide motif or regulatory element common to these genes. This likely represents a functionally important sequence pattern for energy metabolism gene regulation or expression. The pattern is highly consistent across multiple bacterial genomes, appearing in various taxonomic contexts with similar spike-like activation profiles.",
