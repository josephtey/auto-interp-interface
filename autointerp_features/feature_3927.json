  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image carefully, examining where the feature activations occur in relation to genomic annotations. I looked for patterns in the type, position, and context of genomic elements present at activation sites across all examples.",
  "findings": "Across multiple examples, the feature consistently shows strong activation patterns coinciding with or near tRNA genes. In section_7, the activation directly overlaps with trnE (tRNA-Glu). In section_8, activation corresponds with trnH (tRNA-His). Other examples show activation in regions that could potentially contain unannotated tRNA genes. The activation pattern is sharp and pronounced, typically appearing as a defined peak or cluster of peaks.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes within bacterial genomes, particularly those encoding tRNA-Glu and tRNA-His.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) genes within bacterial genomes. The activation typically occurs directly over the tRNA gene location, showing strong, localized peaks. In examples with labeled tRNAs (tRNA-Glu, tRNA-His), the correspondence is unmistakable. In other examples without explicit tRNA annotations, the activation pattern suggests the possible presence of unannotated tRNA genes. tRNAs are critical components of protein translation, serving as adaptor molecules that deliver amino acids to ribosomes. The feature's consistent activation pattern across examples indicates it has learned to recognize the distinctive secondary structure elements common to tRNA genes (such as cloverleaf structures) from their primary sequence, making it a reliable detector for these essential non-coding RNA elements.",
