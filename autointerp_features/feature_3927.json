  "reasoning": "I analyzed multiple examples to identify what genomic pattern this feature detects. Across examples, I noted high activation peaks consistently overlapping with or adjacent to SGNH/GDSL hydrolase-type esterase domain-containing proteins. These proteins appear in section_0 (ID 1), section_4 (ID 2), section_5 (ID 10), section_6 (ID 4), section_7 (ID 2), section_9 (ID 3), and section_2 (ID 13). The activation pattern forms distinct peaks with strong signal intensities (5-8 units) that precisely map to these enzyme locations across diverse bacterial genomes.",
  "findings": "This feature consistently detects SGNH/GDSL hydrolase family proteins across diverse bacterial phyla including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Mycoplasmas. SGNH hydrolases are characterized by four invariant catalytic residues (Ser, Gly, Asn, His) and function as lipolytic enzymes with broad substrate specificity. The consistent detection pattern suggests the feature recognizes conserved sequence motifs within these enzymes despite their presence in evolutionarily distant organisms. The feature shows strong activation regardless of whether the gene is complete or pseudogenized, indicating recognition of specific sequence patterns rather than functional state.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly captures a biologically meaningful pattern representing the SGNH/GDSL hydrolase enzyme family across diverse bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects SGNH/GDSL hydrolase-type esterase domain-containing proteins across diverse bacterial genomes. It shows consistent, strong activation peaks (5-8 units) precisely aligned with these enzymes, which belong to a family of lipolytic enzymes characterized by a conserved SGNH catalytic tetrad. The feature recognizes these enzymes across taxonomically diverse bacteria including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Mycoplasmas, suggesting it identifies highly conserved sequence motifs specific to this enzyme family. The feature detects both functional and pseudogenized versions, indicating sequence-based rather than function-based recognition. SGNH hydrolases play important roles in bacterial metabolism and host interactions through their diverse hydrolytic activities on lipids and esters.",
