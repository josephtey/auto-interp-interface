  "reasoning": "I examined the pattern of feature activation across all examples, noting the precise locations, intensity, and genomic context. I observed a consistent strong spike activation pattern coinciding with specific genomic elements.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates with sharp, high-intensity spikes at or near tRNA genes in several examples. In section_3.png, strong activation occurs precisely at the location of tRNA-Ala and tRNA-Ile genes. Other examples show activation near ribosomal or translation-related elements, suggesting the feature detects tRNA genes or specific tRNA-associated sequences in bacterial genomes. The feature appears active across diverse bacterial phyla, indicating conservation of the recognized element.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes or specific tRNA-adjacent sequences across diverse bacterial genomes.",
  "title": "tRNA gene detector",
  "activation-pattern": "spike",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes or sequences with tRNA-like characteristics in bacterial genomes. The activation consistently appears as sharp, high-magnitude spikes directly at tRNA gene locations, as clearly demonstrated in section_3.png where activation aligns precisely with tRNA-Ala and tRNA-Ile genes. The feature's recognition appears conserved across phylogenetically diverse bacteria, including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and CFB group bacteria, suggesting it captures fundamental sequence characteristics of these essential translation machinery components. The consistency and specificity of activation pattern strongly suggests this feature identifies sequence motifs that define tRNA genes or their immediate contexts.",
