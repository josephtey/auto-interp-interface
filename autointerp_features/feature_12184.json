{
  "reasoning": "I analyzed activation patterns across 10 genomic regions, examining the relationship between feature activation and gene annotations. I focused on identifying common elements where activation consistently occurs.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates in regions containing phage-related proteins, particularly around phage tail structural components and associated proteins. Strong activations appear over regions with phage tail tape measure proteins, minor tail proteins, and other phage tail components across multiple bacterial and archaeal genomes. The activation spans these phage modules rather than showing pinpoint specificity for individual genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern associated with phage tail assemblies and related structural components.",
  "title": "Phage tail assembly module detector",
  "activation-pattern": "continuous",
  "description": "This feature detects regions containing phage tail structural components and assembly modules. It shows broad, continuous activation across genomic regions encoding phage tail proteins (especially tail tape measure proteins), tail fiber proteins, minor tail proteins, and associated structural elements. The feature appears to recognize the genetic signature of complete or partial prophage tail assembly modules rather than individual genes. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla (including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria) and even some archaeal genomes, suggesting it captures a conserved genetic architecture common to many phage types. The broad activation pattern likely corresponds to the complex, multi-gene nature of phage tail assemblies, which require numerous coordinated structural components.",
