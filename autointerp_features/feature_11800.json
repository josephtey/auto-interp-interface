  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example to identify where the feature activates and what genomic elements are present at those locations. I observed sharp activation spikes occurring at very specific genomic positions across different bacterial species. I looked for patterns in gene content, relative positioning, and function in the surrounding regions.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently activates at precise genomic locations that don't appear to correlate with specific gene boundaries or promoter regions. The activation occurs in diverse bacterial species including Shewanella, Parasphingorhabdus, Arsenophonus, Chryseobacterium, Paenibacillus, Aeromonas, and Ferroplasma. The surrounding genes vary widely in function across examples, with no clear functional pattern. The feature's sharp, isolated spikes suggest it may detect a specific short sequence motif rather than a functional genomic element.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect a specific DNA sequence motif that occurs across diverse bacterial genomes, but does not correlate with specific gene functions or genomic elements.",

  "description": "This feature detects a specific DNA sequence motif that appears in diverse bacterial genomes. The feature activates with sharp, isolated spikes that occur at precise genomic locations without consistent association to specific gene types or functional elements. The motif appears across different bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and even Archaea), suggesting it may be a widely conserved sequence element. The lack of correlation with specific gene functions or genomic landmarks suggests this may represent a structurally important DNA motif or possibly a binding site for a broadly conserved DNA-binding protein. The pattern is consistent across examples with uniform spike-like activation, but without clear biological function from surrounding annotations.",
