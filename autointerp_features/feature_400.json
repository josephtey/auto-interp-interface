  "reasoning": "I analyzed the activation patterns across 10 genomic regions from diverse organisms, looking for consistent correlations between feature activation and specific genomic elements. I observed that strong activation clusters appear consistently in regions containing genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, particularly carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (cooS) and associated pathways.",
  "findings": "In multiple examples (6, 2, 4), the feature shows strongest activation over or near the cooS gene encoding anaerobic carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase. In other examples, activation occurs over genes involved in anaerobic metabolic processes like nitrogen fixation (8), methylaspartate metabolism (4), or enzyme systems that function in low-oxygen environments. The feature appears to detect genomic regions associated with anaerobic metabolism pathways, with strongest signals specifically for cooS genes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature consistently detects genomic sequences associated with anaerobic metabolism, particularly carbon monoxide dehydrogenase genes.",

  "description": "This feature primarily detects the cooS gene encoding anaerobic carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase and surrounding sequences involved in anaerobic metabolism. The activation pattern shows strong, continuous signals spanning the entire cooS gene region with multiple high peaks. In examples without cooS, the feature activates on related anaerobic metabolism genes (nitrogen fixation, methylaspartate pathways). The feature appears to recognize sequence patterns specific to genes enabling energy metabolism under anaerobic conditions, particularly in firmicutes but also across diverse bacterial phyla. This suggests the feature identifies conserved sequence motifs critical for anaerobic energy metabolism.",
