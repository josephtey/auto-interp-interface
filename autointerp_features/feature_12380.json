  "reasoning": "I analyzed each example carefully, noting where the feature activates in relation to genomic annotations. The activation pattern consistently shows sharp, singular spikes in all examples. I examined the surrounding genes and their functions to identify common patterns.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows sharp activation spikes near non-coding RNA elements or at locations near gene boundaries. In section_8, the spike appears directly at a 6S RNA (ID 4). In section_1, the spike is near a tRNA-Met (ID 3). Several other examples show activation at apparent junctions between genes or potential regulatory regions. The pattern appears across diverse bacterial taxa including proteobacteria, enterobacteria, firmicutes, and archaeal genomes.",
  "conclusion": "This feature appears to detect specific non-coding RNA motifs or regulatory elements at gene boundaries across diverse prokaryotes.",

  "description": "This feature detects non-coding RNA elements or gene boundary regions across prokaryotic genomes. It shows consistent sharp activation spikes at or near annotated ncRNAs (6S RNA, tRNAs) or at intergenic regions that may contain regulatory elements. The feature appears to identify functional RNA structures or regulatory motifs rather than protein-coding sequences, as it activates at discrete positions rather than across gene bodies. The pattern is highly consistent across diverse bacterial phyla, suggesting it captures a conserved structural or sequence motif important for transcriptional regulation or RNA processing in prokaryotes.",
