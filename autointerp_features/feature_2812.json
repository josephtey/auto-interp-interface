  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify the genomic elements consistently associated with high activation patterns. I observed that the feature activates strongly over ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, particularly 16S and 23S rRNA. By examining the position, strength, and context of activations across examples, I determined that this feature primarily detects rRNA sequences, with particularly strong signals for 16S and 23S rRNAs.",
  "findings": "In all examples with high activation, the feature consistently activates across the span of 16S or 23S rRNA genes. The activation pattern spans the entire length of these genes with fluctuating intensity. Both Bacillus (firmicutes) and Cronobacter (enterobacteria) genomes show this pattern, indicating the feature detects a conserved aspect of bacterial rRNA. The feature shows higher activation toward the 5' end of 16S rRNA in some examples, and distributed activation patterns across 23S rRNA in others.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects bacterial ribosomal RNA genes, primarily 16S and 23S rRNA, across diverse bacterial species.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects bacterial ribosomal RNA genes, predominantly 16S and 23S rRNA. It activates continuously across the entire length of these genes with fluctuating intensity, suggesting sensitivity to the complex secondary structure elements characteristic of rRNAs. The feature appears agnostic to bacterial taxonomy, detecting rRNAs in both Firmicutes (Bacillus) and Enterobacteria (Cronobacter), indicating it captures conserved aspects of bacterial ribosomal RNA. The biological significance relates to ribosomal RNA's essential role in protein synthesis and cellular function. The pattern is highly consistent across examples, with strong activation specifically over annotated rRNA regions and not other RNA types or protein-coding genes.",
