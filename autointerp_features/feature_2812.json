  "reasoning": "I analyzed each image to identify consistent patterns in feature activation relative to genomic annotations. I looked for relationships between activation peaks and specific genomic elements, focusing on their location, context, and function. I compared activation patterns across all examples to find common denominators, paying attention to both the presence and absence of activation around different elements.",
  "findings": "The feature consistently shows high activation around tRNA and rRNA genes. In sections 0, 7, and 9, strong activation peaks align directly with tRNA genes (trnL, rrl/23S rRNA) or occur immediately adjacent to them. Section 2 shows activation adjacent to trnV. The feature appears to detect non-coding RNA elements or their surrounding regions. The activation strength varies but consistently forms distinctive patterns around these RNA genes. No other genomic elements show such consistent correlation with activation.",
  "conclusion": "The feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern related to non-coding RNA genes, particularly tRNAs and rRNAs, potentially detecting sequence motifs or structural signatures that characterize these elements.",
  "title": "Non-coding RNA gene detection feature",
  "activation-pattern": "continuous",
  "description": "This feature specifically detects transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes or their immediate flanking regions. The activation peaks are strongly and consistently associated with these non-coding RNA elements across multiple examples. In section 0, activation aligns with trnL; in sections 7 and 9, activation corresponds to rrl (23S rRNA); and in section 2, activation appears near trnV. This suggests the feature recognizes conserved sequence or structural characteristics unique to these essential non-coding RNA genes, which are critical for protein synthesis and cellular function. The consistency of this pattern across diverse genomic contexts indicates this is a robust feature for identifying these crucial RNA elements in bacterial genomes.",
