  "reasoning": "I examined activation patterns across all examples, noting their positions relative to gene annotations and identifying consistent relationships. I focused on patterns where activation spikes consistently appeared near specific genomic elements, comparing activation strength and context across multiple examples.",
  "findings": "The feature shows strong, sharp activation spikes specifically at tRNA genes and near RNA-related elements. In section_6, it activates precisely at tRNA-fMet genes. In section_7, activation coincides with tRNA-Leu. In section_2, strong activation occurs near ASdes TB sRNA and upstream of 16S rRNA. The feature also shows activation patterns around RNA regulatory elements in other examples, particularly at gene boundaries related to RNA processing or regulation.",
  "conclusion": "This feature robustly detects tRNA genes and other structured RNA elements across bacterial genomes.",

  "description": "This feature specifically detects tRNA genes and other structured RNA elements including sRNAs and rRNAs. The activation pattern shows sharp, distinct spikes precisely at the location of these RNA elements. The feature appears to recognize structural or sequence motifs common to functional RNAs, particularly transfer RNAs. The pattern is highly consistent across examples where RNA elements are present, with strongest activation for tRNA-fMet and tRNA-Leu genes. The feature is active across multiple bacterial taxa, suggesting it detects evolutionarily conserved RNA structures or promoter elements for RNA genes that transcend specific phylogenetic boundaries.",
