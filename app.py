#                 This is a visualization of a sparse autoencoder feature trained on DNA language model embeddings.

#                 You will be shown several images of high-activation patterns of this feature across genomes, along with genome annotations. In each image, the first row shows the feature activation pattern across a 10kb region of a genome, and the rows below that show annotations of that genome. The annotations are labeled with numbers. In the message following the image, you get a legend matching each number to the corresponding annotation. You will be given 10 such images.

#                 Your task is to carefully analyze and interpret what genomic pattern or element this feature detects. Start with detailed observation of individual examples, then synthesize the broader pattern:

#                 1. For each example, examine:
#                 - Precise location of activation peaks relative to annotations
#                 - Strength and shape of the activation pattern
#                 - Specific genes or elements present
#                 - Genomic context (neighboring elements)

#                 2. Then analyze across examples:
#                 - Common elements or motifs that appear repeatedly
#                 - Consistent positioning patterns (e.g. upstream/downstream)
#                 - Biological relationships between co-occurring elements
#                 - Taxonomic or evolutionary patterns across organisms

#                 This feature description must be consistently evident across MOST examples to be considered valid. Random or inconsistent patterns should be labeled as such.

#                 Remember, the more often and the stronger a feature fires, the more important the annotation is at the location The feature could be specific to a gene family, a structural motif, a sequence motif, a regulatory element, etc.  These WILL be used to predict unseen DNA sequences by the feature so only highlight relevant factors for this.

#                 Please provide the following structured analysis:
#                 - reasoning: [description of your analytical process]
#                 - findings: [details of discovered biological patterns, focusing on scientific significance]
#                 - conclusion: [short assessment of whether this feature captures a biologically meaningful pattern]
#                 - title: [concise descriptor, max 50 chars]
#                 - activation-pattern: [start/end/continuous/spike]
#                 - description: [detailed explanation of:
#                   - What specific genomic element(s) the feature detects
#                   - How the feature relates to those elements (position, context)
#                   - What biological function this may represent
#                   - How consistent the pattern is across examples
#                   - If significant, what organism this feature tends to be active in]
